# Document Generation Requirements

This document defines when the TrustScaffold wizard must generate each baseline document.

The implementation has two layers:

1. The human-readable generation contract in this document.
2. The typed rule source in [lib/wizard/document-generation-rules.ts](../lib/wizard/document-generation-rules.ts), which feeds the wizard expected-document preview.

The compile action still performs the final database selection by computing selected criteria from wizard answers and selecting active templates whose `criteria_mapped` overlap those criteria.

## Generation Model

Security is mandatory for SOC 2 readiness in TrustScaffold. The wizard schema requires `tscSelections.security` to be `true`, so Security documents are generated for every successful compile.

Optional Trust Services Criteria add documents when selected:

| Wizard Answer | Criteria Added | Document Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tscSelections.security === true` | `CC1` through `CC9` | Generate all Security baseline documents. This is always true. |
| `tscSelections.availability === true` | `A1` | Add Availability documents. |
| `tscSelections.confidentiality === true` | `C1` | Add Confidentiality documents. |
| `tscSelections.processingIntegrity === true` | `PI1` | Add Processing Integrity documents. |
| `tscSelections.privacy === true` | `P1` through `P8` | Add Privacy documents. |
| `scope.containsPhi === true` | `HIPAA` | Add HIPAA high-water-mark documents. |
| `scope.hasCardholderDataEnvironment === true` | `PCI` | Add PCI-DSS high-water-mark documents. |
| `company.soxApplicability !== 'none'` | `SOX` | Add SOX / ITGC readiness documents. |
| `company.hasPublicWebsite === true` and (`company.websiteTargetsEuOrUkResidents === true` or `company.websiteUsesCookiesAnalytics === true`) | `GDPR` | Add GDPR/privacy high-water-mark coverage and DPIA support. |
| `company.hasPublicWebsite === true` and (`company.websiteTargetsCaliforniaResidents === true` or `company.websiteSellsOrSharesPersonalInformation === true`) | `CCPA` | Add CCPA/CPRA obligations to the legal registry. |
| Security baseline | `COMMON` | Add universal common-control foundation documents. |
| `governance.iso27001.targeted === true` | `ISO27001` | Add ISO 27001 readiness documents. |

Other wizard answers generally tailor document content rather than determine whether a document is generated. For example, cloud provider, IdP, VCS provider, subservice organizations, peer review, MFA, and internal audit answers change language, sections, warnings, and evidence requests inside generated documents.

## Compile Preconditions

The compile action must not generate documents unless the wizard payload passes schema validation and these fields are present:

| Required Field | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `company.name` | Used in all generated documents and filenames. |
| `scope.systemName` | Required for system boundary and product references. |
| `scope.systemDescription` | Required for the System Description and audit-readiness narrative. |
| Active dashboard organization | Required to assign generated documents to the current workspace. |
| User role is `admin` or `editor` | Required to create or update generated drafts. |

## Recommendation-Only Triggers

Some answers should warn, recommend, or tailor content, but should not silently change the generated document set unless the user selects the corresponding TSC.

| Answer Pattern | Wizard Behavior | Generation Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scope.dataTypesHandled` includes `Customer PII` and Privacy is not selected | Warn or recommend Privacy. | Do not generate the Privacy Notice unless `tscSelections.privacy` is true; website GDPR/CCPA answers may still update legal-registry/DPIA outputs. |
| `scope.containsPhi === true` and Privacy is not selected | Warn that PHI often requires privacy-oriented handling. | Generate HIPAA high-water-mark documents; do not generate the Privacy Notice unless `tscSelections.privacy` is true. |
| `scope.hasCardholderDataEnvironment === true` and Confidentiality is not selected | Warn that CDE scope may require confidentiality-oriented controls and PCI segmentation language. | Generate PCI high-water-mark documents; do not generate Confidentiality documents unless `tscSelections.confidentiality` is true. |
| Website exists and collects personal data, uses cookies/analytics, targets EU/UK residents, targets California residents, sells/shares personal information, or allows children under 13 | Ask website privacy and regulatory applicability questions. | Generate legal-registry coverage; generate DPIA when GDPR/UK GDPR or Privacy triggers are present. |
| `subservices.length === 0` | Warn or request confirmation that no material vendors are in scope. | Still generate Vendor Management Policy and Evidence Checklist. |
| `infrastructure.hostsOwnHardware === true` | Show self-hosted/hybrid physical security guidance. | Still generate Physical Security Policy either way; content changes. |
| `company.soxApplicability !== 'none'` | Ask whether SOX / ITGC readiness applies and surface readiness context on the dashboard and review step. | Generate SOX / ITGC templates only when this explicit company-level answer is selected. |
| `operations.requiresPeerReview === false` | Warn about change-management segregation-of-duties risk. | Still generate Change Management Policy; content includes compensating-control language. |
| `governance.hasInternalAuditProgram === false` | Ask for the current monitoring approach and show readiness guidance. | Still generate Internal Audit and Monitoring Policy; content describes the needed cadence. |

## Source Of Truth Responsibilities

| Surface | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [lib/wizard/document-generation-rules.ts](../lib/wizard/document-generation-rules.ts) | Typed rule inventory used by wizard preview and docs. |
| [lib/wizard/schema.ts](../lib/wizard/schema.ts) | Computes selected criteria with `selectedCriteriaCodes(data)`. |
| [app/actions/compile-docs.ts](../app/actions/compile-docs.ts) | Selects active templates where `criteria_mapped` overlaps selected criteria and renders drafts. |
| `public.templates.criteria_mapped` | Database-level mapping that determines final compile inclusion. |
| [lib/wizard/template-manifest.ts](../lib/wizard/template-manifest.ts) | UI-facing expected-template preview derived from typed generation rules. |

## Change Control Requirements

When adding, removing, or changing a generated document:

1. Update the database seed template and any migration needed for existing databases.
2. Update [lib/wizard/document-generation-rules.ts](../lib/wizard/document-generation-rules.ts).
3. Confirm [lib/wizard/template-manifest.ts](../lib/wizard/template-manifest.ts) still derives the expected preview from the rules.
4. Update this document.
5. Run `npx tsx scripts/test-templates.ts`.
6. Run `npx tsx scripts/export-reviewer-pack.ts`.
7. Run `npm run typecheck`.
