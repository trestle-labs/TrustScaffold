# Product Spec V1

> Internal product specification for TrustScaffold V1.0. Describes what ships, why, and the user-facing behavior for each feature area.

---

## Vision

TrustScaffold is an open-source compliance automation platform — starting with SOC 2 Type II. The architecture is framework-agnostic: the template engine, evidence pipeline, audit trail, and auditor portal support any compliance framework via additional template packs (ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI DSS, NIST CSF).

V1.0 transitions from an "AI Document Generator" to a **Canonical Compliance Ledger** (the Control Graph). It captures complex infrastructure intent, enforces an immutable document lifecycle, synchronizes bidirectionally with Git, and presents provable state to external auditors — without relying on human-curated screenshots.

## 1. The Wizard (Intake & Infrastructure Modeling)

### Purpose
An educational compliance coach that captures granular infrastructure data while actively warning against startup compliance anti-patterns ("Lone Wolf" configurations, security theater).

### User Flow
7-stage guided process:
1. **Welcome & Onboarding** — Company name, website, primary contact, industry
2. **System Scope** — System name, description, data types handled, multi-tenant flag
3. **TSC Selection** — Security (mandatory) + optional Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, Privacy
4. **Infrastructure Profiling** — Cloud providers (AWS/Azure/GCP), hybrid/self-hosted flags, IdP selection, cloud-specific toggles (IAM, Macie, Key Vault, SCC, etc.)
5. **Operations** — Ticketing system, VCS provider, HRIS, on-call tooling, MFA/peer-review/insurance toggles, SLA values
6. **Review** — Summary of all selections before generation
7. **Generate** — Server-side Handlebars compilation of 16 templates against wizard data

### Key Behaviors
- **Multi-Cloud Arrays:** User selects multiple cloud providers; compiler outputs conditional Handlebars for all
- **Hybrid/Self-Hosted Logic:** `hostsOwnHardware` flag triggers CC6.4 physical security clauses
- **Sub-Service Mapping:** Vendor array generates Vendor Management Review Matrix
- **Lone Wolf Warnings:** Amber callouts when `requiresPeerReview=false` (CC8.1 SoD) or `requiresMfa=false` (CC6.1)
- **Human-Centric Evidence Prompts:** Evidence checklist prompts for post-mortems, access tickets, onboarding checklists
- **Show Me How Snippets:** Expandable config guides for GitHub branch protection, Azure DevOps branch policies, Entra MFA, Okta MFA, AWS SCPs
- **Idempotency:** Re-running updates existing drafts in-place; never creates duplicates

### Template Library (16 Templates)
See [TSC_MAPPING_AUDIT.md](TSC_MAPPING_AUDIT.md) for the complete criteria-to-template mapping.

## 2. Dashboard & The Control Graph (Lifecycle & Sync)

### Purpose
The immutable ledger of truth managing document lifecycle and preventing backdating, fabrication, or security theater.

### Features
- **Immutable Revisions:** `document_revisions` table. Edits, approvals, merges append new rows.
- **Role-Gated Approvals:** Only `admin` or `approver` roles can transition draft → approved.
- **Hash-Chained Audit Logging:** `audit_logs` with SHA-256 checksums chaining to `previous_event_checksum`. `BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE` trigger blocks mutation.
- **GitOps Export:** Approved docs exported to GitHub/Azure DevOps as branch + PR via `@octokit/rest`.
- **Two-Way Git Sync:** `pull_request` (closed/merged) webhooks hash merged content, compare to local revision, insert `merged` revision if changed.
- **Population List:** `vcs_merge_events` table auto-populated from PR webhooks. `is_self_merged` and `has_review` computed columns for SoD analysis.
- **Audit Snapshots:** `create` (tag) webhooks matching `audit/*` auto-freeze approved revision IDs into `audit_snapshots`.

---

## 3. The Auditor Portal (Distribution)

### Purpose
Zero-setup, read-only verification for external CPAs. Replace evidence chaos with structured, timeline-backed proof.

### Features
- **Time-Boxed Authentication:** Admin generates secure magic link with configurable expiration (default 30 days).
- **Global Overview:** System Description summary, audit dates, snapshot tag under review.
- **TSC Matrix Navigation:** AICPA criteria menu (CC1–CC9, A1, C1, PI1, P1–P8).
- **Provenance Timeline:** Visual Drafted → Approved → Exported → Merged timeline with immutable system timestamps from hash-chain.
- **Anti-Theater Metadata:** SHA-256 checksums and ledger timestamps displayed alongside each revision.
- **Evidence Linkage:** `evidence_artifacts` mapped to specific criteria.

---

## 4. Telemetry-Driven Evidence Ingestion API

### Purpose
Transition from manual screenshot curation to continuous, API-driven telemetry.

### Endpoint
`POST /api/v1/evidence/ingest` — Secured via org-specific API key.

### Features
- **CSPM Integrations:** Auto-detects and normalizes Prowler, Steampipe, CloudQuery JSON.
- **Canonicalized Tamper-Evidence:** RFC 8785 JCS canonicalization → SHA-256 → frozen in Supabase Storage → logged in `evidence_artifacts`.
- **Handlebars Data Binding:** Evidence checklist template renders scanner results as Markdown tables via `{{#each evidence_runs}}` with `countByStatus` and `formatDate` helpers.
- **Stateless LLM Synthesis:** Optional provider-agnostic layer (`lib/synthesis/llm-synthesis.ts`) for formal compliance narrative generation. Raw payloads excluded from prompts. Dry-run mode for auditor transparency.
- **Auditor Verification:** `scripts/verify-hashes.sh` enables independent hash and chain verification.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Idempotency:** Wizard updates existing drafts; never creates duplicates (enforced by unique partial index on `organization_id, template_id WHERE status = 'draft'`).
- **Zero-Trust Client Access:** No PATs, webhook secrets, or service-role keys in client bundle. All Git operations server-side.
- **Tenant Isolation:** RLS on all tables. Organization-scoped access verified by `current_user_has_org_role()`.
- **Build Integrity:** `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` — zero errors.

---

## 6. System Description Auto-Generation (AICPA DC 200)

The `system-description` template programmatically generates a 7-section System Description satisfying AICPA Description Criteria (DC 3):

1. **Company Overview** — Service commitments, TSC scope (conditional sections)
2. **Infrastructure** — Cloud providers (AWS/Azure/GCP), on-premises, hybrid, network architecture
3. **Software** — Application stack, VCS, IdP, supporting software
4. **People** — Organizational structure, personnel controls, SLA values
5. **Procedures** — Change management, incident response, risk management, monitoring
6. **Data** — Classifications, encryption, subservice organizations
7. **TSC Mapping** — Criteria-to-section cross-reference table

---

## 7. Compliance Verification & Housekeeping

- **TSC Mapping Audit:** All templates formally mapped to AICPA TSC 2017. See [TSC_MAPPING_AUDIT.md](TSC_MAPPING_AUDIT.md).
- **Edge-Case Testing:** `scripts/test-templates.ts` compiles all 16 templates across 12 configuration variants (AWS-only, Azure-only, GCP-only, multi-cloud, self-hosted, hybrid, all-TSC, minimal-TSC, lone-wolf, no-vendors, Azure DevOps, multi-vendor).
- **Architecture Docs:** [CONTROL_GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md](CONTROL_GRAPH_ARCHITECTURE.md), [PRODUCT_SPEC_V1.md](PRODUCT_SPEC_V1.md), [BUILD_SPEC.md](BUILD_SPEC.md).
- **Operator Guides:** [LOCAL_DEV.md](LOCAL_DEV.md), [SELF-HOSTING.md](SELF-HOSTING.md).
- **License Audit:** AGPLv3 with NOTICE file documenting third-party dependencies.

## 8. Roadmap (Post-V1)

The next phase of TrustScaffold should optimize for adoption first, then real-world document usability, then extensibility of the underlying compliance platform.

### 8.1 Adoption Foundation

#### Public Demo
- Deploy a seeded demo organization with pre-generated documents, synthetic evidence, and a restricted auditor portal walkthrough.
- Add a launch path from the repository so prospects can understand the product without cloning the repo.

#### CI/CD Confidence
- Add GitHub Actions for lint, typecheck, build, E2E, red team, and Docker build verification.
- Surface status badges prominently so the repository signals production seriousness to evaluators and contributors.

### 8.2 Artifact Export and Employee-Facing Distribution

#### PDF/DOCX Export
- Export approved documents directly from the document view.
- Preserve TrustScaffold revision provenance in the output artifact, including revision metadata or an appendix.

#### SharePoint Publication
- Publish approved PDF/DOCX artifacts into Microsoft 365 / SharePoint libraries.
- Treat SharePoint as the employee-facing distribution layer while TrustScaffold remains the system of record.
- Capture remote item IDs, URLs, publication timestamps, and source revision references.

#### Confluence Publication
- Publish rendered policy pages or attached artifacts into Confluence spaces.
- Support handbook and policy-center use cases where Confluence is the primary internal documentation surface.

#### Later Jira Workflow Integration
- Add Jira-linked tasks for policy review, acknowledgement, recertification, and change-management coordination.
- Do not treat Jira as the canonical document repository.

### 8.3 Template Platform Externalization

- Move from SQL-seeded template content to file-based template packs.
- Add a loader/migration path so baseline templates can be managed as versioned files.
- Create the foundation for bring-your-own-template packs and cleaner community contribution.

### 8.4 Evidence Pipeline Hardening

- Add deeper untrusted-input protection beyond schema validation: payload sanitization, depth and size guards, anomaly logging, and safer storage boundaries.
- Prepare the evidence ingress path for third-party webhook and scanner traffic at production scale.

### 8.5 Integration Expansion

#### Generic Evidence Adapter
- Add a schema-mapping webhook adapter that can accept generic external evidence payloads and map them to internal control references.

#### Native Connectors
- Build first-party connectors on top of the generic adapter surface for high-value evidence sources.
- Keep the adapter/provider split so new integrations do not fork the ingestion model.

### 8.6 Editing and Review UX

- Add Tiptap-based editing for post-generation refinement.
- Pair edits with revision diffs, audit-safe history, and a clear distinction between compiled baseline content and approved user-edited revisions.

### 8.7 Framework Expansion

- Ship ISO 27001 after template packs are externalized so the second framework does not deepen the SQL seed bottleneck.
- Reuse cross-framework control mappings where the same evidence can satisfy multiple frameworks.

### 8.8 Longer-Term Expansion

- Additional framework packs: HIPAA, PCI DSS, NIST CSF.
- AI-assisted policy refinement with clear provenance boundaries.
- Broader continuous-compliance integrations.
- White-label / embeddable deployment options for consultancies and partners.
