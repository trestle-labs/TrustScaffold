### Open Items for CPA Review

1. **CC4 (Monitoring Activities):** No standalone monitoring policy. System Description addresses it in Section V. Determine if a dedicated template is required.
2. **Template language quality:** All templates include the `> This document is a starting-point compliance template and must be reviewed` disclaimer. A CPA should validate that the default language meets board-grade expectations for each engagement type.
