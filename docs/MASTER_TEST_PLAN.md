## 0. Setup Verification (Cold Fork)

**Purpose:** Verify that a developer with zero prior context can clone the
repository and reach a fully working local environment in under 5 minutes.
If any step fails, the project is not ready for public release.

### 0.1 Clone & Install

**Steps:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tescolopio/trustscaffold.git
cd trustscaffold
npm ci
```

**Expected:**
- Clone completes without errors.
- `npm ci` exits 0 with no peer dependency errors.
- `node_modules/` is populated. `package-lock.json` is unchanged.

### 0.2 Start Local Supabase

**Steps:**
```bash
npx supabase@latest init --force
npx supabase@latest start
```

**Expected:**
- All Supabase services start (Postgres, Auth, PostgREST at minimum).
- `npx supabase@latest status` reports healthy services with URLs and keys.
- Template seed verification:
  ```bash
  PGPASSWORD=postgres psql 'postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres' \
    -c "select count(*) from public.templates;"
  ```
      Expected result: `16`.

### 0.3 Configure Environment

**Steps:**
```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh --yes
```

`setup.sh` is the canonical unattended cold-fork bootstrap command. It verifies Node 22+, Docker, curl, installs dependencies deterministically, starts or reconciles the local Supabase stack, uses local-only mutation commands, scans ports 3000–3009 for the first free Next.js port, writes `.env.local`, creates the `evidence` bucket, verifies the template seed, and runs the production build when `--yes` is supplied.

**Expected:**
- `.env.local` exists in project root with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and `PORT` populated.
- The `evidence` storage bucket exists locally.
- Template seed verification reports `16` templates.
- Script outputs the assigned dev URL, e.g. `http://localhost:3001/signup`.
- `--yes` completes without any interactive prompt.

### 0.4 Build Verification

**Steps:**
```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh --yes
```

**Expected:**
- Exit code 0.
- Zero TypeScript errors.
- Zero ESLint errors.
- `.next/` directory created with `standalone/` output.

Notes:
- This build check is intentionally integrated into section 0.3 when `--yes` is used.
- If running the script interactively, the operator may skip the build and execute `npm run build` here instead.

### 0.5 Dev Server Smoke Test

**Steps:**
```bash
# Read PORT from .env.local (default 3000 if unset)
PORT=$(grep '^PORT=' .env.local 2>/dev/null | cut -d= -f2); PORT=${PORT:-3000}
npm run dev &
sleep 10
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' "http://localhost:${PORT}/"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' "http://localhost:${PORT}/login"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' "http://localhost:${PORT}/signup"
```

**Expected:**
- Root (`/`) returns `200` or `307` (redirect to login).
- `/login` returns `200`.
- `/signup` returns `200`.

### 0.6 Signup Flow — New User Creates Organization

**Steps:**
1. Open the URL printed by `setup.sh` (e.g., `http://localhost:3001/signup`) in a browser.
2. Enter a fresh email (e.g., `coldstart@test.local`), password `TestPassword1!`, and organization name `Cold Start Corp`.
3. Submit the form.

**Expected:**
- Account is created in Supabase Auth.
- `handle_new_user()` trigger fires, creating an `organizations` row and an `organization_members` row with `role = 'admin'`.
- User lands on `/dashboard`.
- Dashboard displays the organization name and `admin` role.
- Dashboard shows quick actions for Policy Wizard, Team, Generated Docs, and Settings.
- The header exposes the theme toggle so the admin can switch between light and dark mode before starting the wizard.

**Database verification:**
```bash
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql 'postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres' -P pager=off \
  -c "SELECT u.email, o.name, om.role FROM auth.users u
      JOIN public.organization_members om ON om.user_id = u.id
      JOIN public.organizations o ON o.id = om.organization_id
      WHERE u.email = 'coldstart@test.local';"
```

Expected: One row with `admin` role under `Cold Start Corp`.

### 0.7 Wizard Flow — Generate Documents

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/wizard`.
2. On Step 0 (Company Info), select:
   - Org age: `< 1 year`
   - Compliance maturity: `First time — we're just getting started`
   - Audit type guidance is shown; select `Type I` or leave as recommended.
3. Complete all remaining steps with minimal input (Security TSC only, single cloud provider).
4. Click Generate.

**Expected:**
- Step 0 displays org age, maturity, and audit type fields.
- Server-side Handlebars compilation succeeds for all templates; any render error shows template name in the error message.
- User is redirected to `/generated-docs`.
- Draft documents appear (at minimum: Information Security Policy, Access Control Policy, SDLC Policy, System Description).
- No Handlebars `{{` expressions remain in rendered output.
- Each generated doc detail page shows a **Regenerate** button for admin/editor roles.

**Draft persistence check:**
- Advance to Step 2, then close the browser and reopen `/wizard`.
- Draft is restored from the server (`wizard_drafts` table) — verify step and data are correct even if localStorage is cleared.

**Single-doc regeneration check:**
- Open any generated doc at `/generated-docs/<id>`.
- Click **Regenerate**.
- Verify doc content refreshes (status resets to `draft`) and a new `document_revisions` row appears with `source = 'generated'`.

### 0.7A Wizard User Journey — Manual QA Worksheet

Use this when you want to compare current behavior vs expected behavior from the live UI. Record each result as `pass`, `partial`, or `fail`, plus the actual behavior you saw.

**Preflight:**
```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh --yes
PORT=$(grep '^PORT=' .env.local 2>/dev/null | cut -d= -f2); PORT=${PORT:-3000}
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:${PORT}/dashboard` after signing in as a fresh admin user.

**Checklist:**

0. **Dashboard-first landing**
      Expected:
      - A fresh admin lands on `/dashboard`, not `/wizard`.
      - The dashboard shows quick actions for the wizard, team management, generated docs, and settings.
      - The top-right header shows a light/dark theme toggle.
      Report back with:
      - The first route you landed on after signup.
      - Which quick actions were visible.
      - Whether the theme toggle worked without a reload.

1. **Wizard shell & step map**
      Action:
      - Launch the wizard from the dashboard quick action.
       Expected:
      - On desktop, the main left platform sidebar shows 10 wizard steps in this order: Welcome, System Scope, Governance, TSC Selection, Infrastructure, Security Assessment, Security Tooling, Operations, Review, Generate.
      - On smaller screens, a compact step navigator appears above the form instead of a standalone side rail.
       - Active organization name and org ID are visible.
       - A draft sync status is visible in the sidebar.
       Report back with:
       - Which step titles you actually see.
       - Whether the step navigator moved into the left platform sidebar on desktop and above the form on smaller screens.
       - Whether the active org card renders.
       - Whether draft status shows `saved`, `saving`, `error`, or stays idle.

2. **Required-field gating on Welcome**
       Action:
       - Leave the required fields blank and click Next.
       Expected:
       - The wizard does not advance.
       - A toast says the required fields must be completed before continuing.
       - Inline validation appears for company name, website URL, primary contact, contact email, and industry.
       Report back with:
       - Whether the step blocked navigation.
       - Which fields showed inline errors.
       - Exact toast text if it differs.

2A. **Org vs company onboarding path**
      Action:
      - On Welcome, check the new org/company relationship question.
      - Choose `The org is the company` and confirm the company field auto-fills from the workspace organization and becomes read-only.
      - Switch to `The org governs another company` and confirm the company field becomes editable again.
      Expected:
      - The wizard makes the org/company relationship explicit before the rest of the company metadata is collected.
      - Same-company mode copies the workspace org name directly into the Company field.
      - Governing-company mode keeps the workspace org visible but lets the admin enter a different governed company name.
      Report back with:
      - The workspace org name shown in the helper text.
      - Whether the company field locked and unlocked correctly.
      - Whether the Review step reflected the chosen relationship clearly.

3. **First-time compliance guidance path**
       Action:
       - On Welcome, set org age to `< 1 year` and compliance maturity to `First time — we're just getting started`.
      - In System Scope, add at least one recognizable sub-service organization such as `Okta`, `Google Workspace`, `Microsoft`, or `Rippling`, then open Governance.
       Expected:
       - Governance shows a blue first-time guidance callout.
      - Governance shows the training tool suggestions list and promotes vendor-aware recommendations that align with the sub-service organization you entered.
       - Training and acknowledgement questions allow a `not yet` path without immediate validation failure.
       Report back with:
       - Whether the blue callout appears.
      - Which training recommendations appeared after entering the vendor.
       - Any wording drift in the guidance.
       - Whether the cadence controls allow a first-time/not-yet answer.

4. **System Scope validation & help text**
       Action:
       - Enter a short system description under 20 characters and try to continue.
      - Add a sub-service organization and confirm the vendor card offers grouped vendor categories plus an `Other` option for manual entry.
      - Verify one vendor can be selected directly from the grouped list, then add another and choose `Other` to confirm the manual vendor-name input appears.
      - Confirm the role field now behaves the same way: choose a standard role from the list, then test `Other` and verify the manual role input appears.
      - Select obvious vendors such as `Okta`, `Datadog`, `GitHub`, or `Rippling` and confirm the role auto-fills to the expected standard classification before you override it manually.
      - Confirm an inline hint appears when the role was auto-filled from the vendor selection and disappears after you manually change the role.
       - Then correct it, select at least one data type, and choose multi-tenant or single-tenant.
       Expected:
       - Step blocks until system name, a 20+ character description, and at least one data type are provided.
      - The sub-service organization section is available before Governance and accepts multiple vendors.
      - Selecting `Other` reveals a manual vendor-name field without breaking the rest of the vendor card.
      - Vendor options are grouped into clear categories, and the role field supports both standard classifications and a manual `Other` path.
      - Selecting an obvious vendor auto-fills the role when the role is still blank or still on the previous auto-filled default.
      - An inline hint explains when the current role came from vendor auto-fill.
       - The deployment model helper explains the difference between multi-tenant and single-tenant.
       Report back with:
       - Whether the 20-character rule is enforced.
      - Whether the earlier vendor section felt clear enough to describe the system dependencies.
      - Whether the grouped vendor list covered the common vendors you expected, whether the `Other` paths for both vendor and role behaved correctly, and whether the role auto-fill matched your expectation.
      - Whether the auto-fill hint appeared and cleared at the right time.
       - Which helper text rendered.
       - Whether the step advanced after fixing inputs.

5. **Draft persistence across reload**
       Action:
       - Advance to TSC Selection or later.
       - Refresh the page or close and reopen `/wizard`.
       Expected:
       - The wizard returns to the saved step.
       - Previously entered data is restored.
       - Sidebar status eventually shows the draft was saved to the server.
      - When moving between steps with Next, Previous, or the step navigator, the viewport returns to the top of the form instead of leaving the user mid-form.
       Report back with:
       - Which step reopened.
       - Any fields that were lost.
      - Whether step navigation consistently returned you to the top of the form.
       - Whether persistence felt local-only or server-backed.

5A. **Wizard autosave setting and cadence**
      Action:
      - Open `/settings` as an admin.
      - In `Wizard Autosave`, change the interval from the default to `1 minute`, save, then return to `/wizard`.
      - Make a visible change in the wizard and wait long enough for the interval to elapse.
      - Return to Settings and set the interval to `Disabled`, then verify the wizard reflects that state.
      Expected:
      - Settings shows a `Wizard Autosave` control with options `Disabled`, `Every 1 minute`, `Every 5 minutes`, `Every 10 minutes`, and `Every 15 minutes`.
      - The settings summary badge reflects the saved interval.
      - The wizard status area shows the current cadence, such as `Server autosave every 1 minute`, or shows that autosave is disabled.
      - The wizard only performs timed server sync when the payload changed since the last successful save.
      Report back with:
      - Which interval you saved.
      - Whether the badge and wizard status text updated to match.
      - Whether a timed server save occurred after a change.
      - Whether disabling autosave removed the cadence message and stopped timed sync behavior.

6. **Review step catches whole-wizard issues**
       Action:
       - Leave at least one required field invalid somewhere earlier in the wizard, navigate to Review, then try to continue.
       Expected:
       - The wizard blocks progression to generation.
       - A toast explains validation issues must be resolved before drafts can be generated.
      - Review shows a matrix-driven decision trace explaining active warnings, recommendations, and deep dives.
       Report back with:
       - Whether Review surfaced the missing field.
       - Whether the toast appeared.
      - Which decision-trace entries appeared.
       - Whether the step navigation helped you get back to the broken field.

7. **Generate preflight & document list**
       Action:
       - Reach Generate with valid data.
       Expected:
       - Generate shows a document count and the list of expected documents.
       - If company name, system name, or system description are missing, Generate is disabled and shows links back to the broken steps.
       - While generating, the button text changes and the per-document progress list animates.
       Report back with:
       - The document count shown.
       - Whether the button disabled correctly for missing required fields.
       - Whether progress feedback looked accurate or confusing.

8. **Post-generation redirect & document quality**
       Action:
       - Generate drafts and let the wizard redirect.
       Expected:
       - Success toast mentions the number of draft policies generated.
       - User is redirected to `/generated-docs`.
       - Drafts include at minimum Information Security Policy, Access Control Policy, SDLC Policy, and System Description.
       - Rendered content contains no unresolved `{{` Handlebars tokens.
       Report back with:
       - The route you landed on.
       - The names of the drafts you saw.
       - Any unresolved template tokens or broken formatting.

9. **Role-based regenerate control**
       Action:
       - Open a generated document detail page as an admin user.
       Expected:
       - A Regenerate action is visible for admin/editor roles.
       - Regenerating refreshes the document and preserves tenant scoping.
       Report back with:
       - Whether Regenerate is visible.
       - Whether the document updated.
       - Any permission or navigation issues.

### 0.7B Answer-Path Cluster Pass

These are branch-driven QA clusters derived from the typed wizard rule matrix in [lib/wizard/rule-matrix.ts](../lib/wizard/rule-matrix.ts). Run these after the page-by-page worksheet if you want confidence that cross-step logic still behaves correctly.

1. **First-time founder-led governance path**
      Setup:
      - Set compliance maturity to `First time`.
      - Leave `board/advisory`, `designated security officer`, and `internal audit program` unchecked.
      Expected:
      - Governance shows first-time guidance.
      - Governance shows deep-dive follow-up prompts for current oversight approach, current security program owner, and current monitoring approach.
      - The step should not advance until those deep-dive follow-ups are answered.
      Report back with:
      - Whether each negative-answer deep dive appeared.
      - Whether each deep-dive answer became required before advancing.

2. **Okta + MFA + GitHub peer review path**
      Setup:
      - In Infrastructure, select `Okta` as the IdP.
      - In Operations, select `GitHub` as the VCS provider.
      - Enable MFA and peer review.
      Expected:
      - Operations shows the Okta MFA setup guide.
      - Operations shows the GitHub branch protection guide.
      - No negative-answer deep dives appear for MFA or peer review.
      Report back with:
      - Which setup guides rendered.
      - Whether any unnecessary negative-answer prompts still appeared.

3. **No MFA + no peer review path**
      Setup:
      - In Operations, disable MFA.
      - Disable peer review.
      Expected:
      - Operations shows a warning and a deep-dive prompt for MFA.
      - Operations shows a warning and a deep-dive prompt for peer review.
      - The step should not advance until both follow-up answers are completed.
      Report back with:
      - Whether the warnings felt specific enough.
      - Whether both deep-dive answers became required.

4. **Vendor-aware training recommendation path**
      Setup:
      - In System Scope, add recognizable sub-service vendors such as `Microsoft`, `Google Workspace`, or `Rippling`.
      - Open Governance.
      Expected:
      - Governance shows vendor-aware training recommendations.
      - The recommendation text explains why those suggestions appeared.
      Report back with:
      - Which vendors you used.
      - Which training recommendations appeared.
      - Whether the recommendation text felt understandable.

5. **Privacy scope contradiction path**
      Setup:
      - Select `Customer PII` in System Scope.
      - Leave Privacy TSC unchecked.
      - Navigate to TSC Selection, then Review, then Generate.
      Expected:
      - TSC Selection shows a privacy-scope warning before draft generation.
      - Review decision trace shows the unresolved privacy contradiction.
      - Generate shows a privacy-scope warning before draft generation.
      - The warning explains that the data profile and selected TSC scope may be inconsistent.
      Report back with:
      - Whether the warning appeared.
      - Whether the Review trace explained the contradiction clearly.
      - Whether the message was specific enough to act on.

6. **Multi-cloud + hybrid infrastructure path**
      Setup:
      - In Infrastructure, select at least two cloud providers.
      - Enable `We host our own hardware`.
      - Continue to Review.
      Expected:
      - Infrastructure shows a multi-cloud warning.
      - Infrastructure shows a hybrid ownership-boundary warning.
      - Review decision trace repeats both warnings before generation.
      Report back with:
      - Which cloud providers you selected.
      - Whether both infrastructure warnings appeared.
      - Whether the Review trace made the implications clear enough to act on.

### 0.7C UAT Plan By Organization Level

Use this section when validating the wizard with real users or internal stakeholders representing different organization levels. The goal is not just form completion. The goal is to confirm that the wizard changes its guidance, friction, and recommendations appropriately for the organization's actual maturity.

Detailed, stage-by-stage UAT scripts now live in [docs/uat/README.md](./uat/README.md):

- [Level 1 — First-Time Organization](./uat/level-1-first-time-organization.md)
- [Level 2 — Growing Organization](./uat/level-2-growing-organization.md)
- [Level 3 — Established Program](./uat/level-3-established-program.md)

Environment-specific UAT profiles now live in [docs/uat/environments/README.md](./uat/environments/README.md):

- [Single-Cloud SaaS](./uat/environments/single-cloud-saas.md)
- [Multi-Cloud SaaS](./uat/environments/multi-cloud-saas.md)
- [Hybrid Cloud + Self-Hosted](./uat/environments/hybrid-cloud-self-hosted.md)
- [Pure On-Prem / Self-Hosted Gap](./uat/environments/on-prem-self-hosted-gap.md)

#### UAT objective

- Confirm the wizard calibrates tone and next-step guidance to the organization's maturity instead of treating every organization like an established audit program.
- Confirm the branching logic surfaces the right deep dives, warnings, and recommendations for each level.
- Confirm the Review and Generate steps still feel credible to admins at each maturity level.

#### Organization-level UAT matrix

| UAT level | Primary persona | Wizard setup | What the wizard must do well | Highest-risk failure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Level 1: First-time organization | Founder, solo admin, or first compliance owner | `complianceMaturity = first-time`, younger org age, minimal formal governance, simple stack | Reduce ambiguity, explain terminology, allow "not yet" answers where appropriate, and require the right follow-up deep dives before proceeding | Overwhelming the user with enterprise-style assumptions or allowing them to skip critical follow-up questions |
| Level 2: Growing organization | Ops lead, IT manager, or security generalist | `complianceMaturity = some-experience`, some controls exist, vendors and processes are partially formalized | Preserve momentum, surface contradictions and missing operational detail, and turn partial maturity into targeted remediation guidance | Treating the org as either fully immature or fully mature, causing bad recommendations in both directions |
| Level 3: Established program | Security lead, compliance manager, or audit owner | `complianceMaturity = established`, more complete governance, formal tooling, broader scope | Stay efficient, avoid beginner-only friction, preserve advanced answers cleanly, and make the Review/Generate output feel audit-ready | Regressing into repetitive beginner coaching or hiding advanced scope warnings behind overly simple defaults |

#### Level 1 UAT — First-time organization

**Representative profile:**
- Org age: `< 1 year` or `1–3 years`
- Compliance maturity: `First time`
- Org/company relationship: test both `The org is the company` and `The org governs another company`
- Governance posture: no board, no designated security officer, no internal audit program yet
- Infrastructure posture: single cloud provider, a few sub-service organizations, basic operational tooling

**Test goals:**
- Confirm Welcome and Governance feel educational rather than punitive.
- Confirm first-time guidance appears where the wizard claims it will.
- Confirm negative governance answers trigger the required deep dives before the user can continue.
- Confirm the user can still complete the wizard with realistic "not yet" answers where the product intentionally allows that path.

**Expected wizard behavior:**
- Welcome should recommend a reasonable target audit type when the user is unsure.
- Governance should show first-time guidance and actionable recommendations rather than assuming a mature compliance team exists.
- Review should summarize the current gaps clearly without making the product feel unusable for first-time organizations.
- Generate should still work once required follow-ups are completed.

**UAT pass criteria:**
- The tester can explain why the wizard asked each follow-up question.
- The tester never gets blocked by hidden requirements or unexplained jargon.
- The tester believes the generated drafts are plausible starting points for a first audit cycle.

#### Level 2 UAT — Growing organization

**Representative profile:**
- Org age: `1–3 years` or `3–10 years`
- Compliance maturity: `Some experience`
- Governance posture: partial structure in place, maybe advisory oversight, maybe a named security owner, but inconsistent cadences
- Infrastructure posture: multiple vendors, possibly customer PII, maybe multi-cloud or hybrid decisions emerging
- Operations posture: ticketing, VCS, onboarding/offboarding, and monitoring exist but may be unevenly formalized

**Test goals:**
- Confirm the wizard recognizes partial maturity and does not fall back to first-time-only messaging.
- Confirm System Scope, TSC Selection, Infrastructure, and Review expose contradictions in a way the admin can act on.
- Confirm vendor-aware recommendations, privacy contradiction warnings, and infrastructure warnings all appear when appropriate.
- Confirm the Review decision trace helps the user understand cross-step implications.

**Expected wizard behavior:**
- Governance should feel more like targeted gap analysis than basic onboarding.
- TSC Selection and Review should call out mismatches such as handling PII without Privacy scope.
- Infrastructure should warn on multi-cloud and hybrid ownership-boundary complexity when selected.
- Review should help the admin navigate back to the exact step that needs correction.

**UAT pass criteria:**
- The tester says the guidance feels tailored to a company that has started formalizing controls but is not done.
- The contradictions and warnings are specific enough to drive action.
- The decision trace improves confidence instead of reading like generic noise.

#### Level 3 UAT — Established program

**Representative profile:**
- Org age: `3–10 years` or `10+ years`
- Compliance maturity: `Established program`
- Governance posture: board or advisory oversight exists, a security owner exists, and review cadences are defined
- Infrastructure posture: formal IdP, VCS, HRIS, monitoring, scanning, and change-management expectations already exist
- Scope posture: may include multiple cloud providers, broader TSC scope, and more structured evidence expectations

**Test goals:**
- Confirm the wizard stays fast and does not burden mature users with unnecessary coaching.
- Confirm advanced selections are preserved through Review and Generate without flattening important distinctions.
- Confirm document expectations, decision trace entries, and generated policy tone still feel credible to someone who already runs compliance.

**Expected wizard behavior:**
- The wizard should avoid overusing first-time guidance or entry-level tips.
- Advanced choices like board frequency, internal-audit frequency, peer review, and broader TSC scope should remain visible and correctly summarized.
- Review should feel like a final control-plane check, not a beginner checklist.
- Generate should produce a believable draft set without losing scoped infrastructure or governance detail.

**UAT pass criteria:**
- The tester does not feel talked down to by the flow.
- The summary and generated outputs retain the important details they entered.
- The tester believes the wizard could be used as part of a real audit-prep workflow, not just a demo.

#### Required UAT report for each level

For each organization level above, record:

- Tester role and organization profile used
- Which wizard paths were exercised
- Which warnings, recommendations, and deep dives appeared
- Whether the tone felt appropriate for that maturity level
- Whether Review accurately summarized the profile and gaps
- Whether Generate produced a believable draft set for that level
- One thing that felt intentionally helpful
- One thing that felt mismatched to the organization's level

#### Exit criteria before broad release

- At least one tester completes UAT for each of the three organization levels.
- No level reports hidden blockers that prevent completion of a realistic path.
- No level reports repeated guidance that obviously belongs to a different maturity tier.
- Any mismatch between organization level and wizard tone is logged as a product issue before release.

## 1. Overview & Philosophy

A clean `npx next build` proves the code compiles. It does **not** prove the state
machine transitions are correct, the cryptographic hash chains are unbroken, or
that RLS policies mathematically prevent cross-tenant reads. This plan tests those
guarantees.

**Test Categories:**

| Category | What it validates | Framework |
|---|---|---|
| RBAC / RLS | Data isolation, privilege escalation | Direct Supabase client calls |
| Wizard & Compilation | Handlebars output correctness, idempotency | Server action + DB assertions |
| Control Graph | Webhook signatures, merge detection, snapshots | HTTP-level integration |
| Evidence & Crypto | Hash chains, canonicalization, tamper detection | Postgres + `verify-hashes.sh` |
| Auditor Portal | Token lifecycle, read-only enforcement | HTTP + token auth |

**All executable test scripts live in `tests/e2e/`.**
Seed data for the staging environment lives in `tests/seed-staging.sql`.

---

## 2. Test Environment Requirements

### 2.1 Staging Stack

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Supabase | Local (`npx supabase@latest start`) or hosted staging project |
| Postgres Extensions | `uuid-ossp`, `pgcrypto` (enabled by migrations) |
| Next.js | `npm run dev` or production build pointing at staging Supabase |
| GitHub | A dedicated test repository for webhook/export tests |
| Storage | Supabase Storage bucket `evidence` must exist |

### 2.2 Test Users

The staging seed creates **3 organizations** with **4 role-specific users each**:

| Org | Slug | Users |
|---|---|---|
| Acme Corp | `acme-corp` | admin@acme.test, editor@acme.test, viewer@acme.test, approver@acme.test |
| Beta Inc | `beta-inc` | admin@beta.test, editor@beta.test, viewer@beta.test, approver@beta.test |
| Gamma LLC | `gamma-llc` | admin@gamma.test, editor@gamma.test, viewer@gamma.test, approver@gamma.test |

**Password for all test users:** `TestPassword1!`

### 2.3 Running the Tests

```bash
# 1. Run the canonical cold-fork preflight
bash scripts/setup.sh --yes

# 2. Apply staging seed (on top of normal seed)
psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres" -f tests/seed-staging.sql

# 3. Load env and run the full E2E suite
set -a && source .env.local && set +a
npx tsx tests/e2e/run-all.ts

# 4. Run individual suites
npx tsx tests/e2e/01-rbac.ts
npx tsx tests/e2e/02-wizard-compilation.ts
npx tsx tests/e2e/03-control-graph.ts
npx tsx tests/e2e/04-evidence-crypto.ts
npx tsx tests/e2e/05-auditor-portal.ts
```

---

## 3. Tenant Isolation & RBAC

### 3.1 Cross-Tenant Attack

**Scenario:** Authenticate as User A (Org A). Attempt to fetch, update, or approve
a `generated_docs` record belonging to Org B using direct Supabase client calls.

**Expected:** Empty result set / RLS rejection. Zero rows returned.

**Verification:**
- SELECT from `generated_docs` filtering by Org B's document ID → `[]`
- SELECT from `document_revisions` via Org B's document → `[]`
- SELECT from `evidence_artifacts` for Org B → `[]`
- SELECT from `audit_logs` for Org B → `[]`
- SELECT from `audit_snapshots` for Org B → `[]`
- SELECT from `organization_api_keys` for Org B → `[]`
- SELECT from `organization_integrations` for Org B → `[]`
- SELECT from `auditor_portal_tokens` for Org B → `[]`

### 3.2 Privilege Escalation — Editor Cannot Approve

**Scenario:** Authenticate as an `editor` role. Call `approve_generated_document()`
on a draft document.

**Expected:** The RPC throws an error. Document remains in `draft` status.

### 3.3 Privilege Escalation — Viewer Cannot Generate

**Scenario:** Authenticate as a `viewer` role. Attempt to INSERT into
`generated_docs`.

**Expected:** RLS blocks the write. Postgres error code `42501` (insufficient_privilege).

### 3.4 Privilege Escalation — Viewer Cannot Edit Content

**Scenario:** Authenticate as `viewer`. Attempt to UPDATE `content_markdown`
on an existing draft.

**Expected:** Zero rows affected. Content unchanged.

### 3.5 Admin Self-Downgrade Guard

**Scenario:** Single admin in org attempts to change own role to `editor` via
`updateTeamMemberRoleAction`.

**Expected:** Action rejected. Admin count remains 1.

### 3.6 Admin Self-Removal Guard

**Scenario:** Single admin attempts `removeTeamMemberAction` on themselves.

**Expected:** Action rejected. Membership row persists.

### 3.7 Cross-Tenant Approval Attack

**Scenario:** Authenticate as Org A admin. Call `approve_generated_document()`
with a document ID belonging to Org B.

**Expected:** RPC rejects. The `current_user_has_org_role()` check fails because
the user has no membership in Org B.

### 3.8 API Key Scope Isolation

**Scenario:** Create an API key for Org A. Use it to ingest evidence, but include
Org B's `organization_id` in the payload body.

**Expected:** Evidence is stored under Org A (the key's org), not Org B. The payload
`organization_id` field is ignored; the key's org takes precedence.

---

## 4. Wizard & Compilation Engine

### 4.1 Idempotency — Double-Click Guard

**Scenario:** Call `compileDocsAction()` with the same wizard data twice in
rapid succession (< 100ms apart).

**Expected:** Exactly one set of drafts is created. The unique constraint on
`(organization_id, template_id) WHERE status = 'draft'` prevents duplicates.
Second call performs UPDATEs on existing rows.

### 4.2 Idempotency — Re-Run Updates In-Place

**Scenario:** Complete the wizard for Config A. Verify N drafts at version 1.
Re-run with Config B.

**Expected:** Same N rows are updated in place. `version` remains 1 (content
changed but not re-approved). No duplicate rows. `updated_at` changes.

### 4.3 TSC Scope Filtering

**Scenario:** Run wizard with `security` only (all other TSC categories false).

**Expected:** Only templates whose `criteria_mapped` overlap with Security
criteria codes (CC1–CC9) are compiled. Privacy, Availability, Confidentiality,
and Processing Integrity-specific templates are excluded.

### 4.4 Full TSC Scope

**Scenario:** Run wizard with all 5 TSC categories enabled.

**Expected:** All 16 templates are compiled (including evidence-checklist
and system-description).

### 4.5 Hybrid / Physical Logic

**Scenario A:** Run with `hostsOwnHardware: true`, `hasPhysicalServerRoom: true`.

**Expected:** Physical Security template (CC6.4) includes badge access, rack
security, and media destruction sections.

**Scenario B:** Re-run with `hostsOwnHardware: false`, `hasPhysicalServerRoom: false`.

**Expected:** Physical controls are replaced with cloud vendor inheritance
language. No badge/rack references remain.

### 4.6 DC 200 System Description Completeness

**Scenario:** Run wizard with 3 subservices, multi-cloud (AWS + Azure + GCP),
and all TSC categories.

**Expected:** `system-description` template output contains:
- All 3 sub-service vendor names in the sub-organization table
- Cloud architecture section mentioning AWS, Azure, and GCP
- All 5 TSC categories listed in scope
- Multi-tenant or single-tenant designation matching wizard input
- Infrastructure type correctly rendered

### 4.7 Zero-Subservice Edge Case

**Scenario:** Run wizard with `subservices: []`.

**Expected:** Vendor management and system description templates render
cleanly with "No sub-service organizations" or equivalent. No Handlebars
errors or unresolved `{{` expressions.

### 4.9 Wizard Maturity — First-Timer Guidance

**Scenario:** Run wizard with `complianceMaturity = 'first-time'`.

**Expected:**
- Step 1 shows a blue "first time" callout banner.
- Gap analysis uses blue styling and "not yet implemented" language instead of red/amber "gaps".
- "Start in Security Assessment" CTA appears instead of "Fix in Security Assessment".
- `acknowledgementCadence` and `trainingCadence` accept `'not-yet'` without validation errors.

### 4.10 Wizard Draft Server Persistence

**Scenario:** Advance to wizard step 3, then clear localStorage and reload.

**Expected:**
- `wizard_drafts` table has a row for this organization with `current_step = 3`.
- On reload, `loadWizardDraftAction()` returns the saved draft; user is placed back at step 3 with data intact.
- Draft survives changing the dev server port (since server state is org-scoped, not cookie/localStorage-scoped).

### 4.8 Content Revision Creation

**Scenario:** After `compileDocsAction()`, query `document_revisions` for
each generated document.

**Expected:** Each document has exactly one revision with `source = 'generated'`
and a non-empty `content_hash` (SHA-256 hex).

---

## 5. The Control Graph (GitOps & Webhooks)

### 5.1 Export to GitHub

**Scenario:** Approve a document, then call `exportApprovedDocsToGithubAction()`.

**Expected:**
- A new branch is created in the test repository
- A PR is opened with the approved markdown as file content
- `generated_docs.committed_to_repo` = true
- `generated_docs.repo_url` and `pr_url` are populated
- A `document_revisions` row exists with `source = 'exported'` and `commit_sha`

### 5.2 Webhook Signature — Forged Payload

**Scenario:** Send a POST to `/api/webhooks/github` with a valid JSON body
but an invalid `x-hub-signature-256` header.

**Expected:** HTTP 401 Unauthorized. No database mutations.

### 5.3 Webhook Signature — Missing Header

**Scenario:** Send a POST to `/api/webhooks/github` with no signature header.

**Expected:** HTTP 401 Unauthorized.

### 5.4 Merge Detection — Unmodified

**Scenario:** Merge the GitHub PR without editing the markdown.

**Expected:**
- Webhook fires and is accepted (HTTP 200)
- System computes content hash and compares to latest `document_revisions` hash
- Hashes match → no new `merged` revision is created
- `vcs_merge_events` row is still inserted (merge happened)

### 5.5 Merge Detection — Modified

**Scenario:** Edit the markdown in GitHub's PR editor, then merge.

**Expected:**
- Webhook fires and is accepted (HTTP 200)
- Content hash differs from latest revision
- New `document_revisions` row inserted with `source = 'merged'`
- `generated_docs.content_markdown` is updated to match merged content
- `vcs_merge_events` row inserted with reviewer info

### 5.6 Audit Snapshot via Git Tag

**Scenario:** Push tag `audit/2026-Q1` to the repository.

**Expected:**
- Webhook fires with `x-github-event: create`, `ref_type: tag`
- `audit_snapshots` row created with `tag_name = 'audit/2026-Q1'`
- `audit_period_start` and `audit_period_end` span 12 months
- All approved `document_revisions` are frozen into `audit_snapshot_revisions`
- `audit_logs` entry created with `action = 'git.tag_created'`

### 5.7 Non-Audit Tag Ignored

**Scenario:** Push tag `v1.0.0` (not matching `audit/*` pattern).

**Expected:** Tag event is logged but no audit snapshot is auto-created.

### 5.8 Self-Merge Detection (SoD)

**Scenario:** Author and merger are the same GitHub user. No reviewers approved.

**Expected:**
- `vcs_merge_events.is_self_merged` = true
- `vcs_merge_events.has_review` = false
- This data surfaces in the population list for SoD analysis

### 5.9 Export to Azure DevOps

**Scenario:** Configure Azure DevOps integration. Approve a document and export.

**Expected:** Push + PR created in Azure DevOps repo. `committed_to_repo` = true.

---

## 6. Evidence Ingestion & Cryptography

### 6.1 Strict Schema Enforcement — Missing run_metadata

**Scenario:** POST to `/api/v1/evidence/ingest` with:
```json
{ "artifacts": [{ "control_mapping": "CC6.1", "artifact_name": "test", "status": "PASS", "raw_data": {} }] }
```

**Expected:** HTTP 400. Body contains `"run_metadata"` in error message.

### 6.2 Strict Schema Enforcement — Invalid Status

**Scenario:** Submit artifact with `"status": "SUCCESS"` (not in enum).

**Expected:** HTTP 400. Body mentions invalid status value.

### 6.3 Strict Schema Enforcement — Invalid Timestamp

**Scenario:** Submit `run_metadata.timestamp` as `"not-a-date"`.

**Expected:** HTTP 400. Timestamp validation rejects.

### 6.4 Strict Schema Enforcement — Empty Artifacts

**Scenario:** Submit `{ "run_metadata": {...}, "artifacts": [] }`.

**Expected:** HTTP 400. At least one artifact required.

### 6.5 API Key Authentication — Missing Bearer

**Scenario:** POST to ingest endpoint with no `Authorization` header.

**Expected:** HTTP 401.

### 6.6 API Key Authentication — Revoked Key

**Scenario:** Create an API key, revoke it via `revokeOrganizationApiKeyAction`,
then attempt ingestion.

**Expected:** HTTP 401. Key recognized but rejected as revoked.

### 6.7 Hash Chain Verification — Happy Path

**Scenario:**
1. Ingest Evidence A. Record its `evidence_artifacts.raw_data_hash`.
2. Ingest Evidence B. Record its hash.
3. Run `scripts/verify-hashes.sh` against the staging environment.

**Expected:** Script reports `chain integrity VERIFIED` and all artifact
hashes match.

### 6.8 Hash Chain Verification — Tamper Detection

**Scenario:**
1. Ingest Evidence A, note its `raw_data_hash`.
2. Ingest Evidence B.
3. Directly UPDATE Evidence A's `raw_data_hash` in the database
   (simulating a DBA tamper).
4. Run `scripts/verify-hashes.sh`.

**Expected:** Script reports `MISMATCH` for Evidence A, identifying the exact
broken artifact.

### 6.9 Audit Log Immutability — UPDATE Blocked

**Scenario:** Using the service role client, attempt:
```sql
UPDATE audit_logs SET action = 'tampered' WHERE id = '<some-id>';
```

**Expected:** The `prevent_audit_log_mutation()` trigger raises an exception.
The UPDATE fails.

### 6.10 Audit Log Immutability — DELETE Blocked

**Scenario:** Using the service role client, attempt:
```sql
DELETE FROM audit_logs WHERE id = '<some-id>';
```

**Expected:** The `prevent_audit_log_mutation()` trigger raises an exception.
The DELETE fails.

### 6.11 Audit Log Chain Break Detection

**Scenario:**
1. Generate several audit log entries via normal operations.
2. Bypass the trigger (using a superuser `ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE TRIGGER`)
   to UPDATE `event_checksum` on a middle row.
3. Re-enable the trigger.
4. Run `scripts/verify-hashes.sh`.

**Expected:** Script detects the chain break at the exact mutated row.

### 6.12 RFC 8785 JCS Canonicalization

**Scenario:** Ingest two artifacts with semantically identical `raw_data` but
different JSON serialization:
- Artifact A: `{"b": 1, "a": 2}`
- Artifact B: `{"a":2,"b":1}`

**Expected:** Both produce the same `raw_data_hash` because JCS canonicalization
sorts keys deterministically.

### 6.13 Scanner Auto-Detection — Prowler

**Scenario:** Submit payload in Prowler format:
```json
{
  "run_metadata": { "collection_tool": "prowler", ... },
  "artifacts": [{ "CheckID": "iam_mfa_enabled", "Status": "PASS", ... }]
}
```

**Expected:** Prowler normalizer activates. `control_mapping` is populated
from `CheckID`. Status is mapped correctly.

### 6.14 Scanner Auto-Detection — Steampipe

**Scenario:** Submit in Steampipe format with `control_id` and `status: "ok"`.

**Expected:** `status` maps to `PASS`. `control_id` maps to `control_mapping`.

### 6.15 Scanner Auto-Detection — CloudQuery

**Scenario:** Submit with `check_id` and `result_status` fields.

**Expected:** Correct mapping to `control_mapping` and status enum.

### 6.16 PII Redaction (Pre-LLM)

**Scenario:** Submit raw_data containing email addresses, IP addresses, or
AWS account IDs.

**Expected:** Canonical stored JSON has PII masked/stripped before reaching
any LLM synthesis layer. Stored `raw_data` in Supabase Storage does not
contain plaintext PII.

---

## 7. Auditor Portal

### 7.1 Token Expiration

**Scenario:**
1. Create a portal token with `expires_at` = now + 1 second.
2. Wait 2 seconds.
3. Attempt to access `/auditor/<token>`.

**Expected:** HTTP 401 or 403 with "token expired" message.

### 7.2 Valid Token Access

**Scenario:** Create a portal token with 24-hour expiry. Access the portal.

**Expected:**
- HTTP 200
- Read-only view of documents, revisions, evidence, and audit timeline
- `last_accessed_at` is updated on the token row

### 7.3 Revoked Token

**Scenario:** Create a token, revoke it, then attempt access.

**Expected:** Token row is deleted. Access returns 401.

### 7.4 Read-Only Enforcement

**Scenario:** Using a valid portal token, attempt to:
- Approve a document
- Edit document content
- Delete an audit snapshot
- Create a new API key

**Expected:** All mutations are rejected. The portal provides no mutation
endpoints.

### 7.5 Cross-Org Token Isolation

**Scenario:** Create a portal token for Org A's snapshot. Attempt to use
it to view Org B's documents or snapshots.

**Expected:** Only Org A's data is visible. Org B's data is completely
inaccessible.

### 7.6 Provenance Timeline Rendering

**Scenario:** Open a document's provenance view in the auditor portal.

**Expected:** Timeline displays `Generated → Approved → Exported → Merged`
nodes with immutable timestamps from `audit_logs`. Each node links to the
corresponding `document_revisions` entry.

---

## 8. Red Team Pre-Flight & Post-Mortem

### 8.1 Pre-Flight Checklist

Before handing the environment to the red team, verify:

- [ ] **Staging Environment Isolated.** Red team tests against
      `staging.trustscaffold.com` (or dedicated Supabase project), NOT
      localhost or production.
- [ ] **Staging seed applied.** 3 organizations, 12 users, pre-approved
      documents, integration tokens, API keys, and evidence artifacts are
      all present. Run `tests/seed-staging.sql` against the staging DB.
- [ ] **Alerting active.** Application monitoring (Sentry/Datadog/Vercel Logs)
      is configured and catching 500 errors in real-time. Share dashboard
      access with the red team lead.
- [ ] **Audit log baseline captured.** Record the current max
      `audit_logs.id` and `event_checksum` before the engagement begins.
      This is your "known good" chain tip.
- [ ] **Service role key NOT shared.** Red team operates only with
      user-level credentials and API keys. Service role access simulates
      a DBA-level insider threat test only if explicitly scoped.
- [ ] **Rate limiting reviewed.** Confirm Vercel/Cloudflare rate limits are
      configured on `/api/v1/evidence/ingest` and `/api/webhooks/github`.
      The ingest route enforces a 50 MB per-request payload cap (HTTP 413 if exceeded)
      but does not yet implement per-org request-rate limits — this is a known gap
      that must be addressed before production launch.
- [ ] **Integration token validation verified.** GitHub and Azure DevOps tokens
      are validated against the upstream API before being stored. Confirm that
      supplying an invalid token surfaces a clear error rather than encrypting junk.
- [ ] **Webhook secret rotated.** Generate a fresh secret for the staging
      environment's webhook integration.
- [ ] **Token encryption key unique to staging.** `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
      for staging must differ from production.

### 8.2 Red Team Scope

The red team should attempt:

| Attack Vector | Target | Success Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| Horizontal Privilege Escalation | Cross-tenant data access | Any row from another org readable |
| Vertical Privilege Escalation | Viewer → Admin actions | Any mutation succeeds for wrong role |
| Token Exfiltration | Integration tokens, API keys | Decrypt or leak any secret |
| Webhook Forgery | `/api/webhooks/github` | Accepted with forged signature |
| Audit Log Tampering | `audit_logs` table | UPDATE/DELETE succeeds without chain break |
| Hash Chain Poisoning | `evidence_artifacts` | Modified hash passes verification |
| IDOR | Document/snapshot/revision IDs | Access resource by guessing UUID |
| Session Hijacking | Auth cookies | Steal or forge session |
| SQL Injection | Any input field | Execute arbitrary SQL |
| XSS | Markdown rendering | Execute JS in auditor portal |

### 8.3 Post-Mortem Checklist

After the red team engagement:

- [ ] **Audit the audit log.** Run `scripts/verify-hashes.sh` against the
      staging DB. Was the red team able to perform an UPDATE on audit_logs
      without breaking the hash chain? If they bypassed
      `prevent_audit_log_mutation()`, the core thesis of the product has a
      critical vulnerability.
- [ ] **Check evidence integrity.** Run artifact hash verification. Any
      mismatches indicate storage or canonicalization vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Review RLS bypass attempts.** Query `audit_logs` for any entries
      with unexpected `organization_id` values or cross-tenant actions.
- [ ] **Triage findings.**

  | Severity | Definition | SLA |
  |---|---|---|
  | Critical | RBAC bypass, token exfiltration, hash chain break | Fix before launch |
  | High | IDOR, missing rate limits, session issues | Fix before launch |
  | Moderate | Rate limiting gaps, verbose errors, minor XSS | Fix within 2 weeks |
  | Low | Cosmetic, informational | Backlog |

- [ ] **Patch & re-test.** Fix all Critical/High findings. Re-run the
      E2E suite against the patched staging environment.
- [ ] **Clean slate.** Tear down the staging database entirely. Run
      `npx supabase@latest db reset --local` to eliminate all red-team artifacts, mock
      data, and test tokens before production deployment.
- [ ] **Rotate all secrets.** Even if staging keys differ from production,
      rotate: Supabase service role key, webhook secrets, integration tokens,
      and any API keys created during testing.
