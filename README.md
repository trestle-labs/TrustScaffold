TrustScaffold is a **self-hostable compliance platform** that guides teams through an intelligent 10-step wizard to generate framework-mapped policy documents, enforce an immutable audit trail, and present provable compliance state to external auditors.

SOC 2 is the first supported framework — covering both **Type I** (control design at a point in time) and **Type II** (operating effectiveness over an audit period). The wizard and templates establish the control design; the evidence ingestion API, hash-chained audit log, and auditor portal prove ongoing effectiveness. The template-driven architecture is designed to support ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and NIST CSF via additional template packs.

Choose your compliance framework and criteria, describe your infrastructure (public cloud, hybrid, or self-hosted), identify your sub-service organizations, and receive pre-filled, legal-review-ready documentation that lands directly in your Git repository as a pull request.

> **No more blank Markdown files. No more manual copy-paste.** Build your compliance foundation in minutes and understand exactly how each policy and control maps to the standards your business is targeting.

## Why I Built This

Helping a startup stand up its compliance and IT security program was one of the most rewarding and defining moments of my career.

Drafting the documentation, seeing it come together, and aligning business objectives with technical controls was incredibly fulfilling, but it was also a massive undertaking that took months of effort, late nights, and a steep learning curve.

The hard part is that most teams are moving fast for customers, so compliance gets pushed to the back burner.

I loved the ideas behind projects like StrongDM's Comply, but I wanted to build something that is practical, approachable, and usable by everyone in the company, not just compliance specialists or developers.

TrustScaffold is my attempt to make compliance both approachable and defensible, with evidence and revision history built in from day one.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** | 22+ | `node --version` to verify |
| **Docker** | 20+ | Required for local Supabase |
| **npm** | 10+ | Ships with Node.js 22 |

---

## Quick Start — Local Development (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/tescolopio/trustscaffold.git
cd trustscaffold

# 2. Bootstrap local development
bash scripts/setup.sh
# or unattended cold-fork verification:
# bash scripts/setup.sh --yes

# 3. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

The setup script checks Node 22+, Docker, curl, installs dependencies with `npm ci` when the lockfile is present, starts or reuses the local Supabase stack, writes `.env.local`, ensures the `evidence` bucket exists, verifies the template seed, and can run the production build for unattended validation.

Open the signup URL printed by the script, then create an account and land on `/dashboard`.

> **Run the E2E test suite:** [`docs/MASTER_TEST_PLAN.md`](docs/MASTER_TEST_PLAN.md)

---

## Quick Start — Docker (Self-Host)

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/tescolopio/trustscaffold.git
cd trustscaffold

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase project URL and keys

# 3. Build and start
docker compose up -d --build

# 4. Verify
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost:3000/
# Expected: 200 or 307 (redirect to login)
```

The included [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) produces a minimal 3-stage production image. The [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) wires it up with environment variables and health checks.

## Quick Start — Vercel + Managed Supabase

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.

2. Deploy to Vercel:

   [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/tescolopio/trustscaffold)

3. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).

4. Set environment variables in Vercel:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-app-client-id          # optional
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-app-client-secret   # optional
   ```

5. Apply database migrations via the Supabase dashboard SQL editor or `supabase db push`.

6. Open your deployed URL → start your first wizard!

## How the Wizard Works

1. **Welcome** — Company profile, organization relationship, compliance maturity, and target audit type
2. **Infrastructure** — Cloud profile, identity provider, and hosting model
3. **System Scope** — In-scope system, data types, PHI/CDE flags, and tenant model
4. **Governance** — Oversight, ownership, internal audit posture, and training baseline
5. **TSC Selection** — Security (mandatory) plus optional Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, and Privacy
6. **Security Assessment** — Readiness review across document, logging, ruleset, configuration, vulnerability, backup, and monitoring domains
7. **Security Tooling** — SIEM, endpoint protection, vulnerability scanning, MDM, DAST, and log-retention choices
8. **Operations** — Ticketing, VCS, HRIS, access lifecycle, change review, risk register, and publication method
9. **Review** — Decision trace, score summary, and expected document preview before generation
10. **Generate** — Server-side compilation of the selected document set with environment-specific guidance
