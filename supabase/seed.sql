# Access Control and On/Offboarding Policy

## Objective
{{organization_name}} grants access according to least privilege and removes access promptly when employment or engagement changes.

## Provisioning
- Hiring managers submit access requests with role, systems, and justification.
- Access to production systems requires approval from {{approver_name}} or a delegated admin.
- Shared accounts are prohibited unless explicitly approved and logged.

## Authentication
- MFA is required for administrative access.
- Passwords must be stored only in approved password managers.
{{#if uses_azure}}
- Workforce identities are managed through Microsoft Entra ID conditional access policies.
{{/if}}
{{#if uses_aws}}
- Console access in AWS requires federated or SSO-backed identities wherever feasible.
{{/if}}
{{#if uses_gcp}}
- Console access in GCP requires federated or SSO-backed identities, least-privilege IAM roles, and monitored privileged access.
{{/if}}

## Role Changes and Reviews
- Access is reviewed every {{access_review_frequency}}.
- Privileged roles are re-certified by the system owner.

## Offboarding
- Access revocation begins within {{offboarding_sla_hours}} hours of termination notice.
- Device return, token revocation, and credential invalidation are documented.

## Standard Operating Procedure: Access Requests and Revocation
1. The requester opens an access ticket in {{ticketing_system}} with the user, role, system, business justification, and requested access duration.
2. The approving manager or system owner validates the access need and records approval before provisioning.
3. The control operator provisions only the approved role or group and attaches provisioning evidence to the ticket.
4. Access changes, privileged grants, and emergency access are reviewed during the next access review cycle.
5. Offboarding tickets document account disablement, session/token revocation, device return, and evidence retained by the control operator.

## Evidence
{{organization_name}} retains approval and revocation records in its ticketing and identity systems.

# Incident Response Plan

## Purpose
{{organization_name}} responds to suspected or confirmed security incidents using documented roles, escalation paths, and recovery procedures.

## Incident Team
- Incident Commander: {{incident_commander_name}}
- Communications Lead: {{communications_lead_name}}
- Executive Sponsor: {{executive_sponsor_name}}

## Severity and Escalation
- Triage begins within {{triage_sla_minutes}} minutes of detection.
- Customer-impacting incidents trigger executive escalation and communication workflows.
{{#if has_customer_notification_commitment}}
- External notifications are issued within {{customer_notification_window}} when contractual or regulatory obligations apply.
{{/if}}

## Response Lifecycle
1. Detect and validate the event.
2. Contain the threat and preserve evidence.
3. Eradicate the root cause and restore service.
4. Conduct a post-incident review and assign corrective actions.

## Standard Operating Procedure: Incident Execution
1. The on-call responder opens or updates an incident ticket in {{ticketing_system}} and records detection source, affected systems, initial severity, and timeline start.
2. The Incident Commander assigns investigation, containment, communications, and evidence-preservation owners.
3. Responders preserve relevant logs, alerts, screenshots, forensic artifacts, and customer-impact analysis before destructive remediation where feasible.
4. The Communications Lead documents internal and external notification decisions, including rationale when notification is not required.
5. The post-incident review records root cause, corrective actions, owners, due dates, and evidence of completion.

## Logging and Evidence
Security-relevant events from infrastructure, identity, and application layers are retained according to the log retention schedule.

## Cloud Context
{{#if uses_aws}}
- AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and service-native logs are reviewed during incident investigation.
{{/if}}
{{#if uses_azure}}
- Azure Activity Logs, Entra ID logs, and Defender alerts are reviewed during incident investigation.
{{/if}}
{{#if uses_gcp}}
- GCP Cloud Audit Logs, Security Command Center findings, and project-level IAM changes are reviewed during incident investigation.
{{/if}}
{{#if uses_hybrid}}
- Hybrid and on-premise investigations include VPN, bastion, physical-access, and endpoint telemetry where those systems may affect incident scope.

# Change Management Policy

## Purpose
Changes to systems supporting {{primary_product_name}} must be documented, reviewed, approved, and validated before release unless emergency procedures apply.

## Standard Changes
- Every change includes a summary, affected services, rollback plan, and testing evidence.
- Peer review is required before deployment to production.
- High-risk changes require approval from {{approver_name}}.

## Segregation of Duties in Deployments
- Production deployments require {{approval_count}} peer approval before merge or release, recorded in {{ticketing_system}} or {{source_control_tool}}.
- Technical guardrails in {{source_control_tool}} enforce branch protection, required reviews, status checks, restricted merges, and administrative override logging for production branches.
- Self-approval is prohibited: the same individual may not author, approve, and deploy a production change without documented compensating management review.
- Emergency changes that bypass a normal guardrail must receive independent retrospective review within {{post_incident_review_window}}.

## Emergency Changes
Emergency changes may bypass normal approval only to restore availability or reduce active risk, and must be retrospectively reviewed within {{post_incident_review_window}}.

## Standard Operating Procedure: Production Change Workflow
1. The change owner opens a ticket in {{ticketing_system}} with scope, risk, affected services, validation plan, rollback plan, and requested release window.
2. The author submits the change through {{source_control_tool}} and links the pull request, merge request, or release record to the change ticket.
3. Required reviewers validate design, testing, security impact, and rollback readiness before approval.
4. Technical guardrails prevent merge or deployment until required reviews and status checks pass.
5. The control operator attaches deployment evidence, validation results, and rollback outcome to the change record after release.

## Infrastructure-Specific Requirements
{{#if uses_aws}}
- Infrastructure changes in AWS are performed through reviewed infrastructure-as-code repositories.
{{/if}}
{{#if uses_azure}}
- Platform and identity changes in Azure are tracked through pull requests and activity logs.
{{/if}}
{{#if uses_gcp}}
- Platform, IAM, and organization-policy changes in GCP are tracked through reviewed infrastructure-as-code or approved administrative change records.
{{/if}}
{{#if uses_hybrid}}
- Hybrid and on-premise changes include validation of cloud connectivity, segmentation, physical dependency impact, and rollback steps.
{{/if}}

## Evidence
Deployment history, code review records, and validation results are retained for audit support.

# Processing Integrity Policy

## Purpose
{{organization_name}} maintains processing controls so {{primary_product_name}} transactions, workflows, reports, and customer-facing outputs are complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized.

## Scope
This policy applies to production processing for {{primary_product_name}}, including customer data ingestion, identity and access workflows, payment metadata workflows, regulated analytics, support workflows, integrations, scheduled jobs, and administrative processing.

## Processing Objectives
- Processing requirements are defined before material workflows are released or changed.
- Inputs are validated for required fields, format, source authorization, duplicate detection, and business-rule conformance.
- Processing jobs and service workflows record success, failure, retry, and exception states in approved logs or queues.
- Outputs, reports, notifications, and exports are reviewed or tested to confirm completeness and accuracy before release or delivery.
- Processing data is retained, protected, and disposed of according to the Data Retention and Disposal Policy.

## Input and Authorization Controls
- Production processing accepts inputs only from approved users, services, integrations, or subservice organizations.
- Administrative overrides, manual corrections, and privileged processing actions require documented business justification and approval.
- Changes to validation rules, transformation logic, reconciliation jobs, and output generation follow the Change Management Policy.

## Reconciliation and Exception Handling
- High-risk workflows are reconciled against source records, downstream outputs, or control totals at a cadence appropriate to the workflow criticality.
- Processing exceptions are captured in {{ticketing_system}}, assigned an owner, prioritized by customer and compliance impact, and resolved within {{processing_exception_sla}} or documented with an approved exception.
- Failed or partially completed jobs are reviewed to determine customer impact, data correction needs, and notification obligations.

## Procedural Annex: Data Validation and Error Handling
- Procedures for {{primary_product_name}} data validation document the workflow owner, approved input sources, required fields, authorization checks, validation logic, and expected outputs for each material processing workflow.
- Data integrity checks include {{data_integrity_checks}}.
- Validation logic includes {{validation_logic}} and is tested before release through the Change Management Policy.
- Exception queues, failed jobs, reconciliation differences, and manual corrections are reviewed by {{processing_integrity_owner}} or a delegate and linked to tickets in {{ticketing_system}}.
- Corrections preserve the original record, correction rationale, approver, timestamp, and evidence of downstream output review when customer-facing data or reports are affected.

## Monitoring and Evidence
- Processing integrity monitoring is reviewed {{processing_integrity_review_frequency}} by {{processing_integrity_owner}} or a delegate.
- Evidence includes job run logs, validation test results, reconciliation records, exception tickets, correction approvals, and output-review artifacts.
- Material processing defects are evaluated through incident response, risk management, and customer communication procedures when applicable.

## PCI, PHI, and Privacy-Sensitive Processing
{{#if has_cardholder_data_environment}}
- Payment and cardholder-data workflows are designed to keep raw cardholder data within the approved CDE boundary and rely on tokenized or masked values outside that boundary.
{{/if}}
{{#if stores_phi}}
- PHI processing workflows apply minimum-necessary access, audit logging, and correction controls consistent with healthcare-regulated data obligations.
{{/if}}
{{#if scope_includes_privacy}}
- Privacy-impacting processing changes are reviewed for notice, consent, retention, data quality, and data-subject-request implications.
{{/if}}

## Review
This policy is reviewed at least annually and after material changes to processing logic, integrations, payment workflows, regulated analytics, or customer-facing reports.

# Internal Audit and Monitoring Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes {{organization_name}}'s internal audit program and ongoing monitoring activities to evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls, as required by AICPA Trust Services Criteria CC2.1, CC4.1, and CC4.2.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all controls within the SOC 2 trust services criteria boundary, including:
- Logical and physical access controls
- Change management controls
- Security operations controls
- Vendor management controls
- Availability and data protection controls

## 3. Internal Audit Program

### 3.1 Audit Cadence
{{#if has_internal_audit_program}}
{{organization_name}} conducts formal internal audit reviews on a **{{internal_audit_frequency}}** basis.
{{else}}
{{organization_name}} shall establish an internal audit review cadence of at least annually.
{{/if}}
The selected internal audit cadence must be documented as monthly, quarterly, or annually, and annual is the minimum acceptable cadence for SOC 2 readiness.

### 3.2 Audit Activities
Internal audit reviews shall include, at minimum:
- Sampling of access reviews to verify timeliness and completeness.
- Sampling of change management records to verify peer review and approval.
- Review of incident response records for adherence to playbooks.
- Verification that vendor assurance reports are current and reviewed.
- Verification that training completion rates meet the required cadence.
- Review of risk register updates and treatment plan progress.

### 3.3 Audit Independence
Internal audit activities are conducted by personnel who are independent of the processes being reviewed, or by qualified external parties. Where separation of duties is limited by organization size, compensating controls (such as management review) are documented.

## 4. Ongoing Monitoring

### 4.0 Monitoring Frequency Selection
Management reviews control-monitoring results on a **{{control_monitoring_frequency}}** basis. The selected frequency is documented in the audit plan and must be one of monthly, quarterly, or annually.

| Monitoring Area | Minimum Frequency | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access review completion | Quarterly | Completed access review records and remediation tickets |
| Change-management sampling | {{control_monitoring_frequency}} | Sampled change tickets, peer reviews, approvals, and deployment records |
| Incident-response records | {{control_monitoring_frequency}} | Incident tickets, severity classifications, post-incident reviews, and corrective actions |
| Vendor assurance review status | At least annually | Current assurance reports, review notes, and follow-up tickets |
| Risk register and treatment plans | {{control_monitoring_frequency}} | Updated risk register entries and treatment-plan status |

### 4.1 Automated Monitoring
{{#if has_siem}}
- Security events are monitored centrally via {{siem_tool}}.
{{/if}}
{{#if has_monitoring_tool}}
- Infrastructure and capacity metrics are monitored via {{monitoring_tool}}.
{{/if}}
- Alerting thresholds are configured for anomalous access patterns, failed authentication attempts, and unauthorized configuration changes.

### 4.2 Manual Monitoring
- Access reviews are performed quarterly.
{{#if (eq acknowledgement_cadence 'not-yet')}}
- A formal policy acknowledgement cadence is being established and will be verified once adopted.
{{else}}
- Policy acknowledgements are verified per the established cadence ({{acknowledgement_cadence}}).
{{/if}}
{{#if has_phishing_simulation}}
- Phishing simulation results are reviewed {{phishing_simulation_frequency}} to identify awareness gaps.
{{/if}}

## 5. Deficiency Remediation

### 5.1 Identification
Control deficiencies identified through internal audit, monitoring, or external feedback are logged in {{ticketing_system}} with:
- Description of the deficiency
- Affected criteria and control objective
- Severity classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

### 5.2 Remediation and Tracking
- Critical and High deficiencies require a remediation plan within **5 business days**.
- All deficiencies are tracked to closure with evidence of remediation.
- Unresolved deficiencies beyond 90 days are escalated to executive leadership{{#if has_board_or_advisory}} and reported to the board/advisory body{{/if}}.

### 5.3 Lessons Learned
Significant deficiencies trigger a review of the control design and, where appropriate, updates to policies, procedures, or monitoring rules.

## 6. Reporting

{{#if has_board_or_advisory}}
Internal audit results are presented to the board or advisory body on a **{{board_meeting_frequency}}** basis.
{{else}}
Internal audit results are presented to executive leadership at least annually.
{{/if}}
Reports include:
- Summary of reviews conducted
- Deficiencies identified and remediation status
- Trends in control effectiveness
- Recommendations for control improvements

## 7. Policy Review

This policy is reviewed and updated at least annually, or following significant organizational changes.

# Business Associate Agreement Template

## Purpose
This template defines minimum Business Associate Agreement (BAA) terms required before {{organization_name}} permits a vendor, subprocessor, contractor, or other business associate to create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information (PHI) for {{primary_product_name}}.

## Required Parties
- Covered entity or customer: to be completed during contract review.
- Business associate: vendor or service provider handling PHI.
- {{organization_name}} owner: {{policy_owner}}.
- Legal or privacy approver: {{privacy_contact_email}}.

## Required BAA Terms
1. The business associate may use or disclose PHI only as permitted by the agreement and applicable law.
2. The business associate must implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards appropriate to the PHI handled.
3. The business associate must report security incidents, breaches, or unauthorized uses or disclosures to {{organization_name}} without unreasonable delay and no later than {{breach_notification_window}}.
4. Subcontractors that handle PHI must agree to equivalent restrictions and safeguards.
5. PHI must be returned, destroyed, or protected under continuing obligations at contract termination.
6. The business associate must make relevant records available for compliance review where required by law or contract.

## Vendor Review Procedure
{{#if has_subprocessors}}
Vendors with PHI access are reviewed through the vendor-management process:

| Vendor | Role | Data Shared | Assurance | Review Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
{{#each subprocessors}}
| {{name}} | {{role}} | {{data_shared}} | {{#if has_assurance_report}}{{assurance_report_type}}{{else}}None documented{{/if}} | {{review_cadence}} |
{{/each}}
{{else}}
No current PHI-handling vendors are listed. The business owner must confirm vendor scope before PHI is shared.
{{/if}}

## Evidence
- Executed BAA or contract addendum for each PHI-handling vendor.
- Vendor security review and assurance report, where available.
- Subcontractor flow-down confirmation.
- Breach notification contact and escalation path.
- Annual BAA review evidence retained {{baa_review_frequency}}.

# Tokenization and Cardholder Data Policy

## Purpose
{{organization_name}} protects cardholder data (CHD) by minimizing storage, using tokenization where feasible, masking display values, and restricting all CHD handling to the approved cardholder data environment (CDE).

## PCI Scope Baseline
- Cardholder data in scope: {{cardholder_data_elements_text}}

## Policy Requirements
- Only the approved in-scope PCI data elements ({{cardholder_data_elements_text}}) may enter the CDE or connected scanning boundary.
- Raw primary account numbers (PANs) may not be stored outside the approved CDE.
- Sensitive authentication data, including full track data, CVV/CVC, and PIN data, may not be stored after authorization.
- PAN display is masked except for personnel with documented business need.
- Tokenized values are used outside the CDE whenever processing does not require raw CHD.
- CDE boundary diagrams, connected systems, administrative paths, and vendor dependencies are reviewed after material changes.
- Encryption and key management follow approved algorithms: {{approved_encryption_algorithms}}.

## Tokenization Procedure
1. Payment workflows identify whether {{cardholder_data_elements_text}} are received, transmitted, processed, stored, or tokenized by a payment processor.
2. Raw CHD is routed only through approved payment components and service providers.
3. Tokens are stored in application systems instead of raw PAN wherever feasible.
4. Logs, support tickets, telemetry, and exports are monitored to prevent CHD leakage.
5. Exceptions require approval from {{approver_name}} and documented compensating controls.

## Evidence
- CDE boundary diagram and system inventory.
- Tokenization or payment-processor configuration.
- Masking screenshots or configuration evidence.
- Key-management and encryption configuration evidence.
- CHD leakage monitoring or log-scrubbing evidence.

# Quarterly Vulnerability Scanning SOP

## Purpose
{{organization_name}} performs recurring vulnerability scans for systems in or connected to the CDE and retains evidence needed for PCI-DSS readiness.

## Scan Program Baseline
- PCI data elements in scope: {{cardholder_data_elements_text}}

## Scan Cadence
- External ASV scans are performed {{asv_scan_frequency}} and after significant CDE changes.
- Internal vulnerability scans are performed {{pci_scan_frequency}} for CDE systems and connected services.
- Failed scans are remediated and rescanned until passing results are obtained.

## Procedure
1. Confirm current CDE scope, in-scope PCI data elements ({{cardholder_data_elements_text}}), internet-facing assets, connected systems, and payment-provider integrations.
2. Schedule ASV scans and internal authenticated scans.
3. Triage results by severity, exploitability, exposure, and CDE impact.
4. Track remediation in {{ticketing_system}} with owner, due date, evidence, and rescan result.
5. Retain scan reports, attestation status, remediation tickets, and exception approvals.

## Remediation Expectations
High-risk findings must be remediated within {{vulnerability_remediation_sla}}. Exceptions require risk acceptance by {{approver_name}}, compensating controls, and a target remediation date.

# Asset Management and Cryptographic Inventory

## Purpose
{{organization_name}} maintains an asset and cryptographic inventory to support SOC 2, ISO 27001, SOX / ITGC, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and privacy control expectations.

## Asset Inventory
| Asset / System | Type | Environment | Data Classification | Owner | Criticality | Evidence Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {{primary_product_name}} production application | Application | Production | Confidential / regulated as applicable | {{system_owner_name}} | High | System Description |
| Identity provider: {{idp_provider}} | Identity service | Production | Workforce identity data | {{control_operator}} | High | Access-control evidence |
| Ticketing system: {{ticketing_system}} | Workflow system | Production | Operational and incident records | {{control_operator}} | Medium | Ticket exports |

## Cryptographic Inventory
| Mechanism | Purpose | Algorithm / Standard | Key Owner | Rotation Cadence | Storage / Service | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data at rest encryption | Protect stored customer and company data | AES-256 or provider equivalent | {{control_operator}} | {{key_rotation_frequency}} | Cloud KMS or managed service | Encryption configuration |
| Data in transit encryption | Protect network transmission | TLS {{minimum_tls_version}} or stronger | {{control_operator}} | Certificate lifecycle | Load balancer / application endpoint | TLS scan or certificate record |
| Backup encryption | Protect backup copies | Provider-managed encryption | {{control_operator}} | {{key_rotation_frequency}} | Backup service | Backup configuration |

## Review Procedure
- Inventory owners review assets and cryptographic mechanisms {{cryptographic_inventory_review_frequency}}.
- New systems, data stores, keys, certificates, payment components, PHI stores, or privacy-impacting datasets must be added before production use.
- Retired assets must be removed only after data disposal, access revocation, and evidence retention are complete.
- Weak, deprecated, unknown, or undocumented algorithms are tracked as remediation items in {{ticketing_system}}.

# SOX IT General Controls Matrix

## Purpose
{{organization_name}} maintains this matrix to map IT general controls that may support Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) internal control over financial reporting (ICFR), IPO readiness, parent-company control requests, and internal-audit evidence collection.

## Scoping Note
- This is a baseline ITGC matrix, not a legal determination that {{primary_product_name}} is in scope for SOX.
- Selected SOX / ITGC driver: {{sox_applicability_label}}.
- Finance, controllership, internal audit, and system owners should confirm whether the product, connected systems, key reports, interfaces, or spreadsheets affect financial reporting.

## ITGC Matrix
| Control Domain | Control Objective | TrustScaffold Baseline | Typical Evidence | Owner | Review Frequency | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Entity-level governance | Management assigns control ownership, review cadence, and escalation for ITGC issues. | Policy governance, internal audit cadence, and management review operate through the security baseline. | Policy approvals, governance meeting minutes, deficiency log | {{sox_control_owner}} | {{sox_review_frequency}} | Draft |
| User provisioning | Access to in-scope systems is approved before access is granted. | Access requests, approvals, and onboarding flow are documented through the access-control policy and {{hris_provider}} lifecycle process. | Access tickets, approval records, onboarding evidence | {{control_operator}} | {{sox_access_review_frequency}} | Draft |
| Access modification and removal | Role changes and terminations are reflected promptly in connected systems. | Joiner / mover / leaver control relies on {{hris_provider}}, {{idp_provider}}, and the offboarding SLA. | HR change record, termination ticket, deprovisioning screenshots | {{control_operator}} | {{sox_access_review_frequency}} | Draft |
| Privileged access | Elevated access is limited, approved, and reviewed. | MFA, privileged-access restriction, and periodic review expectations are part of the baseline control set. | Admin roster, privileged group export, MFA policy, review sign-off | {{control_operator}} | {{sox_access_review_frequency}} | Draft |
| Access recertification | Management reviews access for key systems on a recurring basis. | Quarterly access review cadence is expected for systems with material operational or reporting impact. | Access review workbook, reviewer sign-off, remediation tickets | {{sox_control_owner}} | {{sox_access_review_frequency}} | Draft |
| Change management | Changes are authorized, tested, reviewed, and promoted through controlled workflows. | Changes to {{primary_product_name}} move through {{source_control_tool}} and {{ticketing_system}} with peer review and approval expectations. | Change ticket, pull request, test evidence, deployment log | {{control_operator}} | {{sox_change_review_frequency}} | Draft |
| Emergency changes | Emergency changes are separately identified, approved, and retrospectively reviewed. | Emergency changes follow the baseline change policy and require after-the-fact review. | Emergency ticket, incident reference, post-change approval | {{control_operator}} | {{sox_change_review_frequency}} | Draft |
| Job operations and monitoring | Scheduled jobs, incident response, and production exceptions are monitored and resolved. | Incident, monitoring, and backup controls create the baseline operating evidence set. | Monitoring alerts, incident tickets, failed-job log, backup results | {{control_operator}} | {{sox_review_frequency}} | Draft |
| Interfaces and key reports | Systems and reports used in reporting or reconciliations are inventoried and reviewed. | To be completed during finance and internal-audit scoping. | Report inventory, interface list, reconciliation evidence | {{finance_system_owner}} | {{sox_review_frequency}} | To be scoped |

## Next Steps
1. Mark systems, reports, integrations, and data extracts that affect ICFR.
2. Assign owners for each access, change, and operations control.
3. Link each control to evidence retained in {{ticketing_system}}, {{source_control_tool}}, {{idp_provider}}, and related systems.
4. Add compensating controls where segregation of duties or automation is limited.

# SOX Access and Change Evidence Request List

## Purpose
This checklist helps {{organization_name}} collect the evidence commonly requested for SOX ITGC reviews across access provisioning, privileged access, access recertification, change management, deployments, and key-report controls for the selected driver: {{sox_applicability_label}}.

## Access Management Evidence
- [ ] Current user listings for in-scope systems from {{idp_provider}} and connected applications.
- [ ] New-access requests with documented approval.
- [ ] Role-change requests and approvals.
- [ ] Termination / offboarding samples showing revocation within {{termination_sla_hours}} hours.
- [ ] Privileged-access roster and business justification.
- [ ] MFA policy screenshots or configuration exports.
- [ ] Quarterly access review sign-off package covering key systems.

## Change Management Evidence
- [ ] Change tickets from {{ticketing_system}} tied to releases or production changes.
- [ ] Pull requests or merge requests from {{source_control_tool}} showing reviewer approval.
- [ ] Test evidence for selected changes.
- [ ] Deployment log or release record.
- [ ] Emergency-change list with retrospective approval.
- [ ] Segregation-of-duties exceptions and compensating controls, if any.

## Operations and Monitoring Evidence
- [ ] Monitoring alerts and incident tickets for material production events.
- [ ] Backup success / restore evidence for critical environments.
- [ ] Problem-management or recurring-issue tracking for failed jobs, integrations, or reconciliations.

## Key Reports and Interfaces
- [ ] Inventory of key reports, data extracts, spreadsheets, and interfaces used in financial reporting or management review.
- [ ] Evidence showing report logic or query ownership.
- [ ] Review or reconciliation evidence for report completeness and accuracy.
- [ ] Change evidence when report logic, interface mappings, or spreadsheet formulas change.

## Review Notes
- Access evidence should be refreshed {{sox_access_review_frequency}}.
- Change-control evidence should be retained {{sox_change_review_frequency}}.
- Internal audit, finance, and system owners should confirm whether additional population exports or reconciliations are required for ICFR scoping.

# SOX Key Report Inventory

## Purpose
{{organization_name}} maintains this inventory to identify key reports, data extracts, spreadsheets, and management-review artifacts that may support financial reporting controls for {{sox_applicability_label}}.

## Key Report Register
| Report / Spreadsheet | Business Purpose | Source System | Owner | Logic Owner | Review Control | Evidence Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue or billing exception report | Detect unusual billing events or missing approvals | {{primary_product_name}} or connected finance workflow | {{finance_system_owner}} | {{control_operator}} | Management review with sign-off | {{ticketing_system}} or finance evidence folder |
| Access review population export | Support quarterly access recertification | {{idp_provider}} and in-scope applications | {{sox_control_owner}} | {{control_operator}} | Reviewer sign-off and remediation tracking | {{ticketing_system}} |
| Change approval population | Support release and deployment review | {{source_control_tool}} and {{ticketing_system}} | {{control_operator}} | {{control_operator}} | Control-owner review | {{ticketing_system}} |

# Complementary User Entity Controls Matrix

## Control Ownership
- Policy Owner: {{policy_owner}}
- Control Operator: {{control_operator}}

## Purpose
{{organization_name}} uses this matrix to document the controls that user entities must operate in order to rely on the services, safeguards, and monitoring described throughout the TrustScaffold readiness pack for {{primary_product_name}}.

## Usage Notes
- These controls are complementary to, not replacements for, the controls operated by {{organization_name}}.
- User entities should evaluate these expectations during onboarding, annual review, and after material service changes.
- This matrix should be shared with customer success, implementation, security review, and procurement stakeholders when control responsibility questions arise.

## Matrix
| Control Area | User Entity Responsibility | Why It Matters | Related TrustScaffold Controls | Example Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
{{#each cuec_rows}}
| {{area}} | {{customer_responsibility}} | {{rationale}} | {{related_controls}} | {{evidence_examples}} |
{{/each}}

## Review Guidance
- Review this matrix {{cuec_review_frequency}}.
- Reconfirm the matrix whenever authentication, data-sharing patterns, customer-managed integrations, or major vendor dependencies materially change.
- Escalate exceptions through the documented security or support contact path before relying on alternate customer-managed procedures.

# Complementary Subservice Organization Controls Register

## Control Ownership
- Policy Owner: {{policy_owner}}
- Control Operator: {{control_operator}}

## Purpose
{{organization_name}} maintains this register to document third-party services, hosting platforms, and other subservice organizations that materially support {{primary_product_name}}, along with the control model used to evaluate those dependencies.

## Dependency Summary
- Material subservice organizations listed: {{subservice_count}}
- Inclusive method dependencies: {{inclusive_subservice_count}}
- Carve-out method dependencies: {{carve_out_subservice_count}}
- Dependencies without current assurance evidence: {{subservice_without_assurance_count}}

## Register
| Subservice Organization | Service Scope | Data Shared / Dependency | Assurance Basis | Control Model | Retained {{organization_name}} Controls | Customer Monitoring Considerations | Review Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
{{#each csoc_rows}}
| {{vendor_name}} | {{service_scope}} | {{data_shared}} | {{assurance_basis}} | {{control_model}} | {{trustscaffold_controls}} | {{customer_monitoring}} | {{review_cadence}} |
{{/each}}

## Review Guidance
- Review this register {{csoc_review_frequency}}.
- Update the register when a new material subservice organization is onboarded, when an assurance report expires or changes method, or when a bridge period introduces compensating controls.
- Where the control model is carve-out, confirm downstream user-control considerations are disclosed to affected customers and reflected in related CUEC materials.

# Management Assertion Letter

## Control Ownership
- Policy Owner: {{policy_owner}}
- Control Operator: {{control_operator}}
- Executive Sponsor: {{executive_sponsor_name}}

## Draft Assertion

{{management_assertion_coverage_statement}}

Management asserts that:
- The system description, complementary control materials, and generated policy set describe the current intended operating model for {{primary_product_name}} as of {{effective_date}}.
- Control responsibilities that remain with customers, vendors, and subservice organizations are identified in the generated reviewer-pack materials where applicable.
- The attached documentation set is intended to support readiness discussions, auditor scoping, customer security reviews, and formal remediation planning.

## Scope Summary
- Selected trust service categories and related frameworks: {{selected_trust_service_categories_text}}
- Generated reviewer-pack documents: {{generated_document_count}}
- Primary system owner: {{system_owner_name}}
- Security contact: {{security_contact_email}}

# Points of Focus Gap Analysis

## Control Ownership
- Policy Owner: {{policy_owner}}
- Control Operator: {{control_operator}}

## Purpose
{{organization_name}} uses this gap analysis to translate active wizard findings into an assessor-style readiness matrix covering criterion intent, evidence expectations, and concrete remediation before an auditor or customer relies on the generated pack.

## Analysis Basis
- Active points of focus identified: {{points_of_focus_gap_count}}
- Selected criteria in scope: {{selected_criteria_codes}}
- Generated reviewer-pack documents considered: {{generated_document_count}}

## Assessor Readiness Matrix
{{#if points_of_focus_gap_count}}
| Priority | Primary Criterion | Criterion Theme | Point of Focus | Wizard Step | Focus Area | Severity | Owner | Status | Signal Type | Assessment Basis | Expected Evidence | Target State | Related Generated Documents |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
{{#each points_of_focus_gap_rows}}
| {{priority_rank}} | {{primary_criterion}} | {{criterion_title}} | {{point_of_focus}} | {{step}} | {{focus_area}} | {{severity}} | {{owner}} | {{status}} | {{signal_type}} | {{assessment_basis}} | {{expected_evidence}} | {{target_state}} | {{related_documents}} |
{{/each}}
{{else}}
No active readiness gaps or evidence prompts were identified from the current wizard decision trace at the time this matrix was generated.
{{/if}}

## How To Use This Matrix
- Start with the lowest-numbered rows and any entries marked `High` severity, then confirm the `Expected Evidence` exists before treating the mapped criterion as audit-ready.
- Use the `Point of Focus` and `Target State` columns as the assessor-style statement of what management should be able to demonstrate for that row.
- Where multiple rows point to the same generated document, update the source policy or supporting evidence once and record how the change satisfies each mapped criterion.
- Re-run the wizard and regenerate the reviewer pack after material remediation so this matrix reflects the current operating model rather than stale decisions.

# Bridge Letter / Comfort Letter

## Control Ownership
- Executive Sponsor: {{executive_sponsor_name}}
- Policy Owner: {{policy_owner}}
- Control Operator: {{control_operator}}

## Current Status Summary
As of {{effective_date}}, {{organization_name}} has prepared the attached TrustScaffold reviewer-pack materials for {{primary_product_name}} to support customer diligence, readiness conversations, and current-state control communication.

{{bridge_letter_program_status}}

The current documentation set covers {{selected_trust_service_categories_text}} and includes {{generated_document_count}} generated documents describing the system boundary, policy framework, complementary controls, and current management follow-up priorities.

This customer-facing status view is scoped to {{bridge_letter_active_frameworks_text}} so privacy-oriented recipients see privacy-relevant follow-up items while HIPAA, PCI-DSS, or other framework-specific items appear only when those frameworks are relevant to the current pack.

## Customer Communication Notes
- This letter is intended to bridge the period between formal assessments, refreshed evidence requests, or customer-specific diligence reviews.
- The attached materials describe management’s current understanding of the operating model, control ownership, and prioritized remediation items.
- Customers should review the complementary user-entity and subservice-organization control materials alongside this letter when evaluating shared responsibility assumptions.
