# Processing Integrity Policy

## Purpose
{{organization_name}} maintains processing controls so {{primary_product_name}} transactions, workflows, reports, and customer-facing outputs are complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized.

## Scope
This policy applies to production processing for {{primary_product_name}}, including customer data ingestion, identity and access workflows, payment metadata workflows, regulated analytics, support workflows, integrations, scheduled jobs, and administrative processing.

## Processing Objectives
- Processing requirements are defined before material workflows are released or changed.
- Inputs are validated for required fields, format, source authorization, duplicate detection, and business-rule conformance.
- Processing jobs and service workflows record success, failure, retry, and exception states in approved logs or queues.
- Outputs, reports, notifications, and exports are reviewed or tested to confirm completeness and accuracy before release or delivery.
- Processing data is retained, protected, and disposed of according to the Data Retention and Disposal Policy.

## Input and Authorization Controls
- Production processing accepts inputs only from approved users, services, integrations, or subservice organizations.
- Administrative overrides, manual corrections, and privileged processing actions require documented business justification and approval.
- Changes to validation rules, transformation logic, reconciliation jobs, and output generation follow the Change Management Policy.

## Reconciliation and Exception Handling
- High-risk workflows are reconciled against source records, downstream outputs, or control totals at a cadence appropriate to the workflow criticality.
- Processing exceptions are captured in {{ticketing_system}}, assigned an owner, prioritized by customer and compliance impact, and resolved within {{processing_exception_sla}} or documented with an approved exception.
- Failed or partially completed jobs are reviewed to determine customer impact, data correction needs, and notification obligations.

## Monitoring and Evidence
- Processing integrity monitoring is reviewed {{processing_integrity_review_frequency}} by {{processing_integrity_owner}} or a delegate.
- Evidence includes job run logs, validation test results, reconciliation records, exception tickets, correction approvals, and output-review artifacts.
- Material processing defects are evaluated through incident response, risk management, and customer communication procedures when applicable.

## PCI, PHI, and Privacy-Sensitive Processing
{{#if has_cardholder_data_environment}}
- Payment and cardholder-data workflows are designed to keep raw cardholder data within the approved CDE boundary and rely on tokenized or masked values outside that boundary.
{{/if}}
{{#if stores_phi}}
- PHI processing workflows apply minimum-necessary access, audit logging, and correction controls consistent with healthcare-regulated data obligations.

- Unresolved deficiencies beyond 90 days are escalated to executive leadership{{#if has_board_or_advisory}} and reported to the board/advisory body{{/if}}.

### 5.3 Lessons Learned
Significant deficiencies trigger a review of the control design and, where appropriate, updates to policies, procedures, or monitoring rules.

## 6. Reporting

{{#if has_board_or_advisory}}
Internal audit results are presented to the board or advisory body on a **{{board_meeting_frequency}}** basis.
{{else}}
Internal audit results are presented to executive leadership at least annually.

# Data Retention and Disposal Policy

{{#if data_classifications}}
{{organization_name}} classifies data into the following categories:
{{#each data_classifications}}
- **{{name}}**: {{description}}
{{/each}}
{{else}}
Data is classified according to the Data Classification and Handling Policy.
{{/if}}

## 4. Retention Schedules

{{#if data_retention_defined}}

{{/if}}

### 4.1 Minimum Retention Requirements

{{/if}}

### 5.2 Paper Records

### 5.3 Disposal Evidence
{{#if has_data_disposal_procedure}}
All disposal actions are tracked with:
- Date of disposal
- Description of data destroyed
- Method of destruction
- Personnel who performed or witnessed the destruction
- Ticket or certificate reference
{{else}}
{{organization_name}} shall implement tracked disposal procedures with verifiable evidence of secure destruction.
{{/if}}

## 6. Customer Data Deletion

### 6.1 Contract Termination
Upon contract termination or customer request:
- Customer data is deleted from production systems within **30 days**.
- Backup copies are purged within the normal backup rotation cycle (maximum {{backup_retention_period}}).

Data deletion requests from customers are handled per the terms of the customer agreement.
{{/if}}

## 7. Subprocessor Data Handling
{{#if has_subprocessors}}
{{#each subprocessors}}
- **{{name}}**: Data shared ({{data_shared}}) is subject to {{name}}'s retention and disposal procedures as evaluated during {{review_cadence}}.
{{/each}}
{{else}}
No subprocessors with material data access are currently in scope.
{{/if}}

## 8. Confidentiality Agreements
{{#if has_nda_process}}
All employees and contractors with access to confidential data are required to sign NDAs or confidentiality agreements prior to access provisioning.
