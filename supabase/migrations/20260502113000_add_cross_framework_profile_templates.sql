# NIST CSF Profile

## Purpose
This profile translates the current TrustScaffold wizard posture for {{primary_product_name}} into the NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions so customers, assessors, and internal stakeholders can review the same operating model through a NIST-oriented lens.

## Scope Summary
- Organization: {{organization_name}}
- System: {{primary_product_name}}
- Active framework scope: {{selected_trust_service_categories_text}}
- Generated-document baseline: {{generated_document_count}} documents

## Function Profile Matrix
| Function | Mapped Criteria | Status | Current Profile | Target Profile | Representative Evidence | Priority Actions | Related Documents |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
{{#each nist_csf_profile_rows}}
| {{function_id}} {{function_name}} | {{mapped_criteria}} | {{status}} | {{current_profile}} | {{target_profile}} | {{representative_evidence}} | {{priority_actions}} | {{related_documents}} |
{{/each}}

## Management Note
This profile is derived from the current wizard answers, active decision-trace items, and generated baseline documents. It is a translation layer for readiness review, not a claim of independent NIST validation.

# Control-to-Framework Crosswalk

## Purpose
This matrix shows how the current generated-document set supports multiple control frameworks at once. It is intended to accelerate customer diligence and internal scoping conversations, not to replace framework-specific testing or assessor judgment.

## Crosswalk Matrix
| Generated Artifact | SOC 2 Coverage | NIST CSF Coverage | ISO 27001 | HIPAA | PCI-DSS | SOX / ITGC | Mapping Basis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
{{#each control_framework_crosswalk_rows}}

{{/each}}

## Review Note
Framework coverage labels reflect direct artifact intent versus shared-control support. Reviewers should still confirm scope, inheritance, and any compensating controls before relying on this crosswalk externally.

# Network and Data Flow Diagrams

## Purpose
This document provides draft Mermaid diagrams derived from the current wizard profile for {{primary_product_name}}. They are intended to accelerate architecture review, customer diligence, and assessor preparation.

## Network Topology Draft
{{network_diagram_status}}

```mermaid
{{network_topology_mermaid}}
```

### Network Diagram Assumptions
{{#each network_diagram_assumptions}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

## Data Flow Draft
{{data_flow_diagram_status}}

```mermaid
{{data_flow_mermaid}}
```

### Data Flow Assumptions
{{#each data_flow_diagram_assumptions}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

## Review Note
These diagrams are generated from questionnaire answers and should be validated against actual deployment architecture, segmentation boundaries, data stores, and approved third-party integrations before external distribution.
